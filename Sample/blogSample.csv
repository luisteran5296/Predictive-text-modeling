"I knew then that the thing that had been in my gut since elementary school was right. That all the altruistic bullshit I had condoned, both implicitly and explicitly, in order to ‘help create a better world,’ was just that – Bullshit. That all the talk about ‘self-sacrifice’ and ‘service to man’ was just the verbal manifestation of the kind of evil that has been the root cause of all the blood-letting and destruction perpetrated by man throughout the ages. Until then I could justify my poor reasoning as mere ‘ignorance.’ But after, I knew that this type of ignorance was not ‘accidental,’ but rather the act of deliberately substituting the beliefs of others in place of my own. I knew then that if I continued to support such beliefs, in any way, that I would be committing the worst kind of sin a man can commit – the sin of moral suicide!"
"They collapse all five skaters around Smith, crushing anyone who tries to carry the puck in the “House” (the high-percentage scoring zone directly in front of the goaltender, extending out to the Faceoff dots and up to the hash marks) and allowing Smith to make all the low-percentage saves. If the Penguins ran the Coyotes ugly-but-effective defense-first system, I guarantee Flower would better Smith’s .930 Save Percentage and 8 Shutouts. Phoenix has to play this way because they have overall inferior talent to teams like the Blackhawks, and that was the case when the Pens played Philadelphia.

"At 3 years 10 months, Colton Burpo was a sunny child, a preacher’s son certain of his faith and his eternal fate. Then his appendix burst, and as doctors failed to figure out what was wrong with him, he lay in a hospital bed until his father, Todd, saw “the shadow of death” cross his face. “I recognized it instantly,” Todd, a pastor, recalls. With Colton’s face “covered in death,” Todd and his wife, Sonja, took the boy to another hospital, where he was wheeled into surgery. “He’s not in good shape,” the surgeon said. As Colton screamed for his father, Todd fled, locked himself in a room and railed at God."
"My husband gave me that name :) because I love food so much just like her (Julia Child), and I love to make something new which I do not like to stick to traditional food. So why not try and put some different flavors together, to give a new flavor which I can enjoy (not always ;) :D but it is good to try) My husband is also like hers, he always encourages me when it comes to my ambitions, even when he is not interested in that thing I wish to do, except for cooking, it is within his circle of interests, he is the one who is going to eat that food, as he likes to put some of his cooking touches sometimes (they are usually such wonderful touches)."

Its officially Autumn in our neck of woods and I must say its not as depressing as I thought it would be. In fact I'm secretly enjoying the gloomy weather and continuous rains to an extent. The only down side is the fact that photography has taken a back seat as it starts getting dark early and since I start cooking only by around 5, I've missed out on what little sunlight is pouring through."

"As I may have mentioned in previous posts, my father had a lot of anxiety through out his life and our childhood. At least that’s how I see it now. As a child, we feared him. He was an unreasonable ogre who required constant busyness from us. Living in the country, there was no lack of work to be done or created to keep us occupied. It seemed he could not tolerate idle children nor could he stand the sound of children laughing or playing. Even the stillness of homework or reading was a cue to him that a chore needed to be assigned. He didn’t dwell much on good grades but he did emphasis the importance of a clean house, manicured grounds and freshly chopped and stacked firewood."

We learned to pour our hearts out for the public. We did these things frequently and without thinking. We could have been writing books and making our millions, but the majority of us didn’t have that kind of foresight."
"And so I continued to try to solve the puzzle of my family, the family who were distant, mythological figures to me. The stories that I heard of them, whenever I did hear a story, sounded so wonderfully romantic. I filled in the rest that I didn't know about, which was most of it, with little snippets of knowledge that I had obtained here and there. Overheard conversations, the few times that I had actually met any of them and what I remembered from those times and of course, the snooping and thus the myth was born. And like most myths, it was all true in its way."

"The reason we noticed this film's uncomfortable white-washing/colorblind racism/callitwhatyouwill, is because, when business really gets going, the Busters hire an additional member of the team: Jesus-loving, down-to-Earth guy, Winston (Ernie Hudson). And then we spend the rest of the move watching him get ignored - sometimes even, literally pushed aside! There were shots where the original three would have their conferences about what to do about Gozer the Gozerian, and Winston would just kinda be off to the side - we think Bill Murray was probably even blocking his line of sight! Then little, insidious things, like when the Busters have to cross their beams, and they each get a close-up shot of their face as they fire up - except, of course, for Winston, who is just shown in the end as being in the crossed beam group. So much for individuating him - out of a group of four, he becomes the only member who is truly amorphous, without distinction. It's really lame."

That’s not bad per se but most of the folks he was now in charge of were more, ummmnn, theoretical than that. Take the brilliant Leo Szliard who was responsible for many breakthroughs in this field. Leo did his best thinking in the bathtub or on long walks. To a guy like Groves, lying in the bathtub for half a day was not an effective use of time. Except, of course, that it was."

Apart from a single statement from Provost Peter Lange rebuking an outright racist screed from then-Duke professor Houston Baker—and a vague, tardy, and ultimately toothless apology from Brodhead—there’s no evidence that anyone from Duke’s administration ever addressed this faculty behavior, or ever rebuked those Duke professors whose private biases led them to ignore their obligations to their own institution’s students."

He served with distinction in the Second and Third Wars, and now is the commanding officer of the paladins of Stormwind. He is also the lead paladin trainer, charged with teaching and preparing young paladins to serve the Alliance. In real life I am a teacher and coach.

That apart I was just wondering what good does IPL do to Indian cricket apart from earning money, money they say is very important but hey remember we never had money problems in India did we ? Our matches and our cricketers were always well paid and there was enough revenue. So, IPL does give more opportunities for our youngsters, while only 20-25 would get a chance of playing for India now many more can hope to be in the game and make their careers. Which is the only good thing I like about IPL a budding cricketer can be now encouraged to take up a sport he loves and not just be worried about his Maths or Science marks all his life whether he likes it or not."

I took off too fast, but tried to hold it as far as I could. I had to back off at about 3/4 of a mile. I could still hold a good pace, but it was slower. We went down a long hill on Kinwest Parkway right off the bat. This looked like it would be our “demon” coming back up for the finish. We turned a corner onto a side street at about a mile out. By then we were at our second water stop. I didn’t stop at this one and at the first, I barely slowed down. I got a little bit in me and some on me.

"The player who generated the most buzz today was easily OT Mike Adams. First, Adams measured in at a strong and very stout 6-7 323 lbs. while displaying a massive 82.5 inch wingspan. This is the type of frame NFL personnel people crave from the position as it gives the player a very good blocking radius to work with to keep defenders at bay. In practice Adams showed up strong again, displaying natural athleticism and power as he showed very good quickness of the snap as well. He was sound with his hand placement and showed nice ability to anchor when bull-rushed. Adams also displayed natural knee bend throughout much of the practice but does tend to get a little upright at times, making it easy for defenders to get up under his pads like Marshall’s Vinny Curry was able to do on one occasion. All in all Adams had one of the better days overall and got a lot of praise from everyone in the scouting community. If he can continue like this the rest of the week he should become a sure-fire 1st round draft pick. Iowa State’s Keleche Osemele struggled at right tackle from what I was able to see. His lack of quality foot speed and quickness was very apparent and he played with poor pad level for much of the practice. I have always believed Osemele’s only fit would be inside due to his tendency to get stuck in the mud and struggle to change directions and keep with quicker defensive lineman. As Mike Mayock said on the broadcast his future lies inside where his massive size and strength can be best utilized as he is more of a phone booth type player. Kevin Zeitler (Wisconsin) had a solid practice overall, showing great technique by always keeping his elbows inside and staying square to his opponent. The leverage he is able to create comes from extremely good coaching and discipline, which all Wisconsin lineman seem to possess. Zeitler may not have the upside of a Cordy Glenn or Keleche Osemele but this is a very good football player who should start early in his career and have an instant impact in the running game. The last player I want to talk about is Ohio State’s Mike Brewster who had an up and down day in my opinion. He started out slow but seemed to gather himself and get more comfortable as the practice went on. Early he was overwhelmed and knocked back on his behind as he struggled with quickness and power showing little ability to anchor. However, as practice went on he displayed the nimble footwork that allows him to gain inside positioning on his opponent to create running lanes off his backside. Brewer is a player who seems to have loads of upside but never shows much consistency from week to week or snap to snap even. I’ll be watching this issue closely over the course of the next few days."

"Monday saw us get together with my family for lasagna. Not your usual Thanksgiving dinner, but none of us care what we eat... we just like to hang out together! My two great nieces were very wound up (they are 8 and 5) and kept us very entertained. The 5 year old handed out fake $100 bills, which she then proceeded to collect from us for some very pricey ""popcorn"" she was making using yellow game pieces. She's going to be a shyster when she grows up! The 8 year old spent a lot of effort trying to convince her mother why she shouldn't have to eat any more veggies but should get an extra piece of cheesecake. We all agreed she's going to be a solicitor."

"I wrote mine because for me writing something means it goes into my head more than if I type something. So it is personal preference. I have previously typed a lot of work and it hasn’t gone any quicker (due to bells and whistles of formatting) but it is easily readable. So if your handwriting is bad this is a good option. Downside is if you type it you have to print it (and bind/secure)."

"Well I'm back. Have you missed me? It's just been so busy around here the last few weeks. Looking back I can't really remember what all we've been up to...but take my word for it, we've had lots going on. Since I last posted, Beau's been to DC and I've been to Chicago, Atlanta and Birmingham for work. We've all been sick and this week we've been working on our taxes (nothing like waiting until the last minute!) and lots of other stuff that is slipping my mind. I really wish that there was some way for me to think things and it end up on this blog without me having to type it all out. There would be all kinds of profound and funny things on here. Maybe one day."

They say I’m the only one going places, the only one making a name for myself, the only one doing something with my life. They say my parents should be proud of me, but they aren’t. I wish just once they would tell me how good I’m doing for myself. I’ll never hear that."

"Leaf removal is the next task. I had all of the leaves collected out of my yard a week ago, only to see a lot of my neighbors leaves come to visit my yard, with the help of the wind we have had. The point I am trying to make is that leaf removal is an ongoing task. Composted or mulched leaves are great as flower bed coverings for winter and a wonderful addition to your compost piles. So recycle your leaf collections and put them to good work in the garden!"

"I can see that interpretation, and even sympathize with it, but I don't accept it. It may be that I do not want to accept it, that I'm reading into Innocence a certain perspective because I am uncomfortable with a world where children's bodies are fetishized and sexualized so thoroughly. A perspective such as Dargis's seems to me hyper-aware of the fetishization -- it seems to be in cahoots with the gaze of the adults in the mysterious audience of the ballets. Her mention of Gaspar Noé is notable as well, and is one that often comes up in the negative reviews of the film: because Hadzihalilovic has collaborated with Noé, been a producer for him, is married to him, and dedicated Innocence to him, therefore her interest in filming the children must contain provocative, and specifically sexual, motives."
"The boy has stuffed his scoop into the slanted tube to catch the pellets sliding down the tube. As he watches the pellets race down the tube into his scoop, he can't help but let out a ""woh"" and ""woh-oh"". It turns into a screech when he removes the scoop and pellets come flooding out of the bottom of the tube. Here, it is interesting to note the role of the observer in this play. The girl on his right adds to the excitement with her screech, too. She has been watching the whole time and has picked up on the boy's excitement. Sometimes we overlook the role of the observer when we analyze children's play. An activity shared is more exciting and joyous."
"A few minutes later we arrive at the Boulevard des Italiens. In front of us, the garish golden façade of the fashionable Maison Doree restaurant. “Bonjour Mr Dickens et Mr Collins” says a voice at the entrance. A door opens and throws light out across the face of my third guest. “Mr Charles Baudelaire. Bonjour” replies Dickens, recognising him from one of his previous visits to the city. I take the three guests through the public part of the establishment up towards the private rooms. “Let me introduce you to our final dinner guest” I announce as I open the door to our individual room."

"A youth needs you to help them achieve the small steps along the path to reaching their goals. This is especially true of the unschooled youth. It's still up to you to help your youth find opportunities and also for you to do some hand-holding. This might mean doing things that we might see as easy but for the youth, quite daunting. For example it might mean making that appointment they're a feeling too nervous to do on their own. It might mean taking them somewhere where they need to go. It might mean helping them raise funds for a project they are working on."

"GR:FS is shaping up to be a pretty solid shooter with awful Kinect controls crowbarred into the mix and therefore doesn’t need this coverage. More importantly, games don’t need this kind of coverage. This advert is self serving and lazy, to say the least. It does nothing to introduce or excite ‘new’ fans. It’s only there for the titilation of 14 year old boys who have already decided they’ll get the game as ‘CODs 4 FagS!!1!’ and that ‘BF3 Blowz!’"
"If I understand this correctly, you want to know who gets all my crappy junk after I’m dead (not my awesome stuff). In all honesty, I would probably bequeath my silly possessions to the local Goodwill or sumsuch.

"The country of Burma, known as Myanmar since 1989, has a long and fractious history. From 1886 until 1948, it was under the colonial power of England, and governed through India. It achieved independence in 1947 and elected Aung San as its leader, but he was quickly assassinated. In 1962, the country fell under the military rule of General Ne Win, who drove the nation into poverty and began the systematic persecution of the minority Karen group, and other “resident aliens” who are not recognized by the government as legitimate citizens."
"Perhaps the most powerful element of the filmmaking alchemy is editing. Margaret's editing has been much commented on, but most commentators fixate on the fact that it took half a decade for the current cut to be arrived at by Lonergan and his editors (Anne McCabe is credited as editor, but apparently Dylan Tichenor, Thelma Schoonmaker and even Martin Scorsese had their hands in cutting at various points in the process.) Many of the film's reviews take for granted that Margaret's editing was never satisfactorily completed. Even certain positive notices start from this assumption, and make claims for the film's successful aspects as achieved in spite of flawed editing choices. If this seemed a justifiable reading after a single viewing of the film, a second made it seem ludicrous unless coming from the perspective of a supporter of the continued homogenizing of American narrative filmmaking."

"Lastly is a Lobby Card from the hilarious Jack Benny/Ann Sheridan film ""George Washington Slept Here""! I gotta say I am quite happy to have a piece of paperware from this fun and silly film! Warner Bros had a weird policy of sometiems printing their Lobby cards on linen textured paper. I have a few others like this as well. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to why they did it!"

"I often wish my mom were here so we could go back and talk about these things. I wish I could visit that horrible fashion-show scene with her now that I'm a grown woman and could have words for her there. I wish we could talk about why appearance was so important and where she wounded me in that. I wish we could cry together and talk and work through the hard things that made our mother-daughter relationship so tense and strained."
"“That was February '04, I was determined that I was going to see this fight forward. I felt that if I wasn’t going to fight this fight that fell into my lap,” he said, there was no other fight he could wage."
"Reveka’s father falls for one of the princesses and I didn’t really believe it. We’re not exactly guided to hate her father, but we aren’t given a whole lot of reasons to like him either. So when it’s revealed that he and one of the princesses have feelings for each other, I just didn’t care. Nor did it seem to really add a whole lot to the story overall."

I'll talk more later about that. Thome rookie (well, Fleer Ultra rookie). The Chicago Greats of Wally Moses is a local set from 1976. Twenty cents - couldn't pass it up. And that Mathews is an 86 Big League Chew. While the image is all washed out, you get a great look at the killer sleeve patches from the Braves of Milwaukee. Total cost on screen: $1.80"

Shoot, I'd make myself some popcorn and serve an ice cold Arnold Palmer and I would read those things from front to back. All these years later, I'm almost positive it would feel like I was reading someone else's story."
"She who can paint a masterpiece or write a book that will influence millions deserves the plaudits and admiration of mankind. But she who would willingly and anxiously rear successfully a family of beautiful healthy sons and daughters whose lives reflect the teachings of the gospel, deserves the highest honors that man can give, and the choicest blessings of God. In fact, in her high duty and service to humanity, endowing with mortality eternal spirits, she is a co-partner with the Great Creator Himself. ― David O. McKay"

"3) Where should I go?"
"When an unsuspecting person can be betrayed as to uphold a presented idea as indicating something real, which means the idea is attributed weight or value, then that person can be somatically affected. The reason is that ideas act as directives to the body, so if the idea is treated as a pointer to some real condition then it will lead to somatic reactivity. The examples as we saw so far are found in the creation of heart attack scare (medically called a panic attacks) and the real heart attack, which are essentially the same thing but with a little preparatory work on the part of the culprits. Thus given the right conditions ideas can be used as powerful weapons but only when the person targeted is unsuspecting of the foul play and medically misinformed."
"It is also a recipe for possibility. Share a vision. Build capacity and skills. Find incentives in focusing on the values based mission of providing together for our learners. Creatively assess and develop resources even in financially trying times. Plan and develop an action plan collaboratively. Celebrate even the small successes."

"I know that seems depressing. It happens to people all the time. I’m always impressed by people who take on physical challenges and overcome them as though it were not a handicap at all, but a great catalyst to success!

"Gordon couldn’t save us, he was a patsy, a fall-guy, a way to placate the fretful, the wary and more especially finance, Gordon understood that I think, understood that his comprehension of the various machinations of finance was a plus and so into office he was permitted. He seems a decent enough guy, if you take away the politics, the garbage, he seems to love his children, his wife and unless it is all spin that is no bad thing, but he had no easy manner, no ready smile, no oration skills, no way to win the masses and indeed even that was not enough, the kind of individual described above toured upon the American speaking circuit or sought ever greater power in the middle-east, putting their easy manner to work robbing a homeland and aiding in the killing of another indigenous people, that individual had walked when told to do so, when the going was good, yet the smile was ever fake."

"I have to say that I will honestly mourn the loss of having a physical book to open...to turn it's pages, and hold it's place on my bookshelf while I'm reading it for the second or third time. Don't get my wrong, I like my Kindle, but those of us who still love the feel of having a book in our hands, turning the pages on your Kindle just doesn't hold the same joy as flipping the pages of a physical book."
"A couple weeks ago, I received a little surprise in the mail from Foodbuzz's Tastemaker Program! A coupon for a bag of Ore-Ida Sweet Potato Fries! Along with the coupon was a letter from Foodbuzz asking me to make something delicious with them! I thought long and hard about making something spectacular and outside the box.

"Answer: Yup, it is real and it does happen. It’s just we make it out to be more than it is and in fact worsen the problems we have by making decades of terrible foreign policy decisions based on perpetual war and occupation and more importantly: a total disregard for the human condition. I want to help you understand more but I suppose I don’t really know what you propose as solutions: when is enough enough? Do we continue the same path we have been going on for a long time and expect different results? Isn’t this the definition of insanity? Would it actually hurt to try something new and in my opinion, not as radical as killing and war? Can we stop waging war on an idea and define our goals better? Is it impossible to believe that our government has acted efficiently and managed effectively? Is it impossible to believe that our government waged war for other things other than to suppress global terror? Is waging war on terror worth the kneejerk reaction to suspend our liberties here at home and let the boobs in Washington use the Constitution as toilet paper? Are peace and prosperity truly radical ideas?"

"He doesn’t quite succeed on either count. The backstory of the Green Lantern mythos is complex and doesn’t lend itself to easy summation. While he departs from comic book canon somewhat during the course of the film, it isn’t enough where he should be alienating the fans of the series much. The place where they have been kicking up a fuss is over the uniform of the Green Lantern, which is computer generated and to be quite honest, doesn’t look very realistic. This was a bit of a misfire."

"This was a brew that didn't match my design, but was quite pleasant. It was hoppy like a pale ale, but .... different. The Sorachi Ace dry hop tended to give lemony, tangerine, but also a slight grassy flavor. So lemongrass. It worked. I do intend to do this again."
"In response to my inevitable and incorrigible backlog of reading – I just finished a writing review of a book sent to me 3 months ago—Skip Fox told me to read 10 pages of everything (though not necessarily the first 10): if it grabs you, keep reading, otherwise, move on to the next.

"Service is a sign of God, the very embodiment of love expressing Himself through us. We are given many occasions to serve and experience love and joy. We need to help our needy brothers and sisters to find the love, joy, and hope we ourselves crave. We can offer our time, energy or money in worship to others. In any situation, especially in crisis we are to respond in love, to be Jesus to the world. Bad things will happen the key is to love in spite of it all. Hate and despair are realities, our role is to offer love, joy, and hope to a world that desperately in need of it. We can extend and offer love instead of hate, hope instead of despair, and joy instead of sadness. We can always do something to show the love and grace that has been lavished on us. We can offer our life to others who need to see how much God loves them. Mother Teresa said that we should find one person who feels they are alone and show them that they are not, that they are loved."
"I actually love the rug, it just wasn't right for the living room. Oh, and there's the part where our dog thinks area rugs = dog toilets. I know. I can see the rug as part of a future outdoor seating area, so I'm holding onto it for now. With the rug gone, the room feels a little bare, but I'm convinced it was the right decision. I also decided to re-paint the frame of the couch. It had already gone from espresso to black, but this time I decided to go from black to white."

"Now it so happens that Ms. Kroes attends Bilderberg almost annually, where she keeps close quarters with the queen. No wonder that she chose of the queen's offspring to become senior advisor at her office. Of all of the prime research areas the prince could envelop himself in, throughout his short career he specifically chose the subjects we identify with the worldwide surveillance grid and the New World Order: RFID tracking technology, a top-down controlled Internet and the promotion of more 'cooperation' worldwide through inflated transnational institutions."
"Light Emitting Diodes (LED’s).

It is thus through the liberal mob’s actions that the truth is being suppressed. It is through their current actions that we’ll one day, in the future sometime, see publications in America and Europe’s leading bookstores speaking of ""The Hidden South African Genocide” – (that is, if the compassionate and caring people of America and Europe have not completely vanished by then!)"

Run and hide is not a very effective or warrior-like strategy, Miro."
"I know John and Anna in the community of dancers who meet every Sunday morning, Monday night, Wednesday night, Friday night. Week after week. Month after month. Year after year… for closing in on two decades now. I see John here right next to me; leaning slightly against me. Wiggling. Jumping up and down. Dancing in quirky ways. Music loud. People moving in ways that’d get them arrested in any supermarket checkout line. Such great joy… shared with each other. And more…somehow, magically, dancing is an antidote to suffering. The energy of dancing together; that joy. Transcendent. Those who dance together are close knit family."
"That’s a real quote from my housemate. She was merrily typing along when one character slammed his fish into another character’s jaw. The second character wondered aloud where the first character had gotten such a large salmon, especially since they were standing in the bowels of a castle in the middle of a land-locked nation. The first character replied that their story’s plot no longer held water. More aquatic puns ensued, and the writing project never really recovered."

Is there anything thicker than the darkness that covers these stoic people with the deep despair of fear of the unknown?"

"Throughout the book there is a deep sense of mystery and otherworldliness, there were parts of the book that gave me chills and it wasn't from something in your face scary, just wrong.

"A friend with an impressive race record confessed that she’s not a good runner. She explained that if she was, then she wouldn’t have suffered countless, prolonged injuries throughout her running life. If I interpret that correctly, it’s to mean that a good runner should not only be concerned about speed, but he or she must also know how to avoid drills that damage the body. I can’t agree more, but it’s always easier said than done. And do I consider myself a good runner? Definitely not."

"The best halo-halo for me is Icebergs halo-halo. I can't get enough of it. It is literally filled with 12 tasty ingredients with 2 scoops of ice cream on top, but I think it's their macapuno balls that made their halo-halo so flavorful. It is served with separate evaporated milk and sugar so you can adjust its taste to your desired creaminess and sweetness. You may think that P118 is too expensive for a glass of halo-halo. But Icebergs halo-halo is served in a large bowl instead of the usual tall glass. Once you tasted it, you'll say that P118 is cheap for its delicious taste."

"Notice that the common denominator that explains psychopathic behavior is the fact that psychopaths need to be IN CONTROL. They are principally motivated by the need to exercise power over others. Stalking behavior is a common strategy that psychopaths use to intimidate their non-compliant victims and an effort to punish them and regain control. For their victims, this is particularly difficult to deal with because stalking laws vary from state to state and because stalking–particularly cyberstalking–is very difficult to establish under the current laws. Generally speaking, one must establish a pattern of stalking as well as harmful intent and threat to safety: all from the same source/stalker. Since stalkers can be very stealthy and know how to erase their traces, reroute their IP address and easily get new email addresses, it’s not easy to take legal action against a psychopathic (cyber)stalker."

The real wakeup call however, would have to be being featured in TILLATE magazine and MIXMAG. These are two publications I’ve been reading since I was 17 so to see myself picked from thousands to be featured is truly amazing."
"An hour or so was spent learning about this very distinctive region of France. Brittany has a history, culture and unique language that existed long before it became part of the 'Hexagon' that we call our country nowadays. Brittany is now very much part of France. Yet its history as well as geographical position set the region in a world of its own. It was fascinating to discuss the very deep and specific traits of the Breton mentality and traditions. One has to decide to go to Brittany; you don’t simply drive through it on your way South and discover it “by chance”. You have to choose to go there!"

"While other minor characters come into play, Rusty and Honor are the focus of the book. The banter between them is hilarious and fun, giving plenty of light moments to the book despite the darkness over their situation. Even with this, however, Kirby triggers the memories of Finn, or the sorrow over his death at all the right moments, giving a very realistic and raw air to the book. With some great unexpected antics along the way, the road trip feel is strong and unforgettable, without being the primary focus of the book."
"I think that Heven went through the biggest internal change, and I loved that about her! (There's nothing worse that a static heroine.) She went from shy and embarrassed to being a better person, inside and out, and not just because she didn't have the scars anymore. She didn't duck her head and suppress herself but she wasn't overly confident either."

After the wedding he’ll be taking me back to NYC and hanging out in the city. That’ll be interesting. I’m excited but as usual a little anxious. We weren’t friends very long face-to-face before he moved away. The last month of which was pretty shitty. So despite the fact that we’re very electronically connected I’m always afraid hanging out is going to be a trainwreck.

She had been raped and killed between the hedge and the house, and the fire was set to try to cover it up.” They said. “She had always hated that little old house and the way it was left to decay. She wouldn’t even walk on the same side of the street as it.” The neighbors all agreed on that. “They had seen her every week coming home from the library to her house a few blocks away. Her house was kept in beautiful condition and her small front garden never had a weed. Such a shame, and a loss to the town now that she was gone.”"

"I couldn’t sleep, too hot for that. Even stripped down to my shirt I felt as if my skin was boiling. That at any moment, I’d erupt like a volcano, steam and blood spurting from the wound. Looking for some shade, I wandered a way from camp and that’s when I heard the music strike up. The first dance was beginning, it’s beat that of war drums, of callused hands smacking against stretched hides. As I listened, staring up at the full moon, the tempo changed, the beat building up and up until it just ….. stopped. Ending abruptly, it’s challenge offered, “Dare you come and join the dance?”. As I made my way back to our encampment, I knew they’d heard the music too. Our move came to the sound of armoured men, boots beating time in the dust, in the shrill shriek of swords being pulled from scabbards and in the orders being yelled."
"I was thinking about all of this as I stepped outside this morning, feeling the strange coolness in the air, the dew under my bare feet in the grass, the peppery scent of the muscadines ripening on the vines.

"On a morning sometime in the 1970s, said friend was eating his croissant fifteen minutes prior to the store's opening in the morning at the health food store he was managing in Queens. Being the seasoned retailer that he was, he had established a firm rule of eating before opening. On this occasion, a woman with an unusual sense of urgency appeared banging at the door, insisting she be let in before the official opening hour. I don't recall the specific reason, but she added fuel to her plea with the statement: ""But I came all the way from Bayside, Queens."" This refrain was repeated ad nauseum emphasizing the words ""all the way from Bayside, Queens."" My friend's response was, ""I don't care where you come from, lady, I am finishing my croissant and I am not opening this door before 9 AM.""

All the plants and trees, creatures and seas are part of my world as much as theirs, but they treat me as if I don’t belong in the world and will somehow make it dirty and soil the water.

The moment this thought flashes though her mind, Prince Charming sat down next to her: „You are looking a little bored.“ True she thought, but does she really feel in the mood to chat with this boy again?

For the first time since I started fishing here, I didn't even see a trout. I had one pool, the Sycamore Pool, left on this section. I had come into this outing both confident and relaxed. This was not going to plan. One thing was especially weird - I was getting divebombed by tree swallows. I've never seen them here before.

The apartment I live in now has three Indian restaurants within 5 minutes. I am so happy here in Austin. If there is one thing I was excited to learn how to cook from scratch it was saag paneer. I could eat it every night for a year and still crave it a week later. I imagined it would take hours and would be hard. Nope, I should have been making this years ago. Making the paneer yesterday took about 3 hours but only 20ish minutes of actual work. I used frozen spinach because that still fits within the rules for the week and costs less than buying an equal amount of fresh. The spices I needed were all at the store-or already in my mom’s cabinet. I fried the paneer and it didn’t stay together well because I guess I didn’t press enough of the whey out yesterday. It still tasted great so who cares? I don’t mind making this again soon to practice my techniques. As I was cutting up the jalapenos my son kept eating pieces off the cutting board. Weird kid. We had dinner in under an hour. It wasn’t exactly like my favorite place makes it but it was pretty close. I’ll try every recipe for it I can find if it gets my son to eat half a bag of spinach in one sitting."

Nodoka and Mako could switch places, but Mako has a somewhat better chance of off-setting any loses from Yuuki compared to Nodoka. It could be another psychological move from Hisa to have Nodoka play after her due to the difference in their styles of play. Regardless, Nodoka is fourth, which leads to…"

"Swelling under carefully controlled conditions has been used to study alterations in the structure of rat liver mitochondria as a result of feeding azodyes. The changes of the swelling properties of the mitochondria during feeding of the hepatocarcinogenic 3′-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene are essentially comparable to those observed previously with the microsomes, under the same dietary conditions. These alterations in mitochondrial swelling are not related to changes in the amount of these cell particulates per unit weight of tissue, during feeding of this azo dye. As with the microsomes, feeding of the isomeric but relatively noncarcinogenic 2-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene does not affect swelling. The structural differences between liver and hepatoma mitochondria show up not only in the rate and extent of swelling but also in the form of the curves of pH dependence. The influence of ketones and sulfhydryl compounds on the swelling of normal liver mitochondria were studied, with particular emphasis to the role of sulfhydryl groups in membrane permeability. The sudden steep rise in the tumor incidence in groups of rats fed 3′-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene for increasing intervals of time occurs at about 4 weeks. This time correlates with the point of the minimum swelling of microsomes and mitochondria isolated from the livers of rats fed this same dye. Thus, a correlation is established between the alterations of the swelling properties of these particulates and the carcinogenic process."

"One thing I find fascinating is how Mexicans continually try to run a business from their home. Our neighbor to the right turned his home into three separate studio apartments. Our neighbor to the left added a boat renovation business. The neighbor beside him decided to build 18 apartment units - they build until he runs out of money, and then it sits, and then it starts up again. The lot across from that neighbor has been fenced for several years, and it looks like they just keep trying to add sand to level out the land - they still have a ways to go."

"Again, the problem is the liberalism, not some unique form of Jewish evil as taansie clearly implies. At this stage it would be quixotic to expel Jewish liberals from the country when there are far greater numbers of non-Jewish liberals. The solution is to emancipate both Jews and non-Jews from their liberalism. And, as Larry Auster and I have both written, this is not going to happen until the consequences of liberalism are so plainly disastrous that further evasion of the truth is impossible. Hence worse is indeed better. But we’re still a long way from that tipping point."

As an active member I promise to be true to all my duties, to be present at and take some part, aside from singing, in every Christian Endeavor prayer-meeting, unless hindered by some reason which I can conscientiously give to my Lord and Master. If obliged to be absent from the monthly consecration meeting of the society, I will, if possible, send at least a verse of Scripture to be read in response to my name at roll-call” (Clark, Christian Endeavor, supra, pp.251-252)."

"Of note is that this procedure was to be done with me lying flat on my stomach on an x-ray bed. Jimmy described the procedure to me: the room was a typical x-ray room, the machine that I was under looked like a giant c-clamp wrapped around the table, and attached to all this was a large flat screen monitor. The “c-clamp” was a type of x-ray that shot an image of my lower back that was presented, like a movie, to the PA doing the procedure. The PA watched the screen, seeing the image of my spine, and performed the puncture. After three numbing injections, PA Jason located where he would insert the needle and then proceeded to do so. Which is when I proceeded to pass out."

"Every year I tell myself I'm going to buy a special, ""real"" vintage outfit to wear, but I still keep being able to cobble together outfits from my existing clothing that look enough of the part so that I can wear something somewhat in the 1920s fashion. The only thing I'm wearing here that's vintage is the fur stole that was my grandmother's, but even that was probably circa 1940. The hat is from Buenos Aires (the main compliment getter today. I am still convinced that people will go out of their way to be nice to you if you are wearing a cute hat.). The shoes are Clarks (even though a fellow waiting in line with me told me they looked more 1930s) and the coat was a bargain at H&M on clearance for $30."

For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.

"The Bible teaches the exact opposite of what Barton says. Barton’s presentation is that America is great because of its Christian heritage. Then James Dobson says that the proof America is favored by God is its weapons of mass destruction that God provided. The notion that the humble Nazarene Jesus who was crucified by the mighty Romans, coerced by the steeped in tradition hypocrite stone carrying Jews, today provides weapons of mass destruction to destroy the very people he died to save is saying that God thinks like man. It is absurd and a great insult to a loving God who sent his Son to die for sinners to present God as a serial killer."
"The Prospect Park killings sparked an outcry from local residents, many of whom knew individual geese by name, and relished them as a rare and vital link to nature.

"The story is fairly simple if you take it at face value. Three boys mysteriously get special powers and start to control and grow them. The fun ends when one of the boys starts to go rogue, which leads to a climax that pits the friends against each other. It’s only when the movie begins that you forget about what you know about the movie from the previews and become immersed in a sad tale of a boy trapped in a desolate and hopeless world. The movie revolves around Andrew (brilliantly played by Dane DeHaan) who has the camera in which most of the film is filmed with. Andrew is a likable guy with some major family problems but he doesn’t let that hurt his disposition as he buys a camera and decides to “chronicle” his life. He doesn’t have many friends and is sort of a loner. It isn’t until him and two others (Matt and Steve) stumble upon a mysterious hole and are given powers that he starts to enjoy the life he films. The first 45 minutes or so are sort of a whimsical experience as the boys challenge their limits and become acquainted with their new powers. The first half of the movie is fun not because of the powers on display but because of the people who display them. Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, and Michael B. Jordan are excellent young talents and with lesser actors, Chronicle would have probably been a one trick pony."

Let’s simply look at how WoW gives any individual player their perception of progress as they continue to play the game. The players’ perceived progress is the beating heart of the MMO experience. No matter what walk of WoW life you’re in, you log in hoping to add something to your character sheet before you log out again, something tangible when you log in the next time. Though the reward mechanisms vary between low-level and max-level WoW, they all exhibit the same pattern: rewards have become increasingly detached from the player’s ability to overcome challenges."

Bulk emails are regarded as spam, as something that can be ignored, but letters almost always generate a response.

For each event, you get a scaled score with a maximum of score of 100. For example, at my age then, I needed to do 87 push-ups, 92 sit-ups, and a 12:18 run to max my score. Now, for the first test they really just want to establish a baseline, so they make you do the two minutes for the push-ups and sit-ups, but only make you do a one mile run."

Today when I was leaving the gym, the words just came to mind: ""I want to be your source."" It kind of stopped me in my tracks and I was not sure where it even came from.

"This weekend saw the start of the 6 nations. A Northern Hemisphere international rugby tournament that the beeb have been good enough to put on the telly. Now I’m not that into rugby. Being a working class lad the sport of Rugby has always struck me as a bit of a posh boy’s game. Soccer or football to give it its proper name is more my game. But only more my game in so far as I understand the rules. I’m not that into it, I haven’t a team I follow. I gather my working class credentials would not be harmed by an interest in Rugby League but what is important about these sports is that however tedious they are they beat a trip round the shops. If you listen to the commentary you can often figure enough about the rules and jargon to give the appearance of knowing something about it."

The writer Barry Lopez illustrates this here:"

Instead everything, at least from her point of view, is a big, scary mystery.

"Despite its male heavy demographics, D.C. proved an effective site for Riot Grrrl organization. The network’s ideologically open punks and hipsters along with the capital’s potential for political and artistic theater enabled activism that could not be matched by any other metropolitan area. In D.C., the printed mini-zine Riot Girl #1 served as a microcosm of the larger explosion in zines that would help define 1990s music and youth culture. Zines provided the life blood of the movement, creating space for ideology, rhetoric, identity, and commonalities. Tobi Vail’s Jigsaw and the Nomy Lamy’s I’m So Fucking Beautiful serve as two prominent examples. Numerous others emerged in this period. These zines resemble those of the 1960s New Left which John McMillian argued created identities and structures for alternative lifestyles, personhood and political dissemination. Obviously, one wonders had the blogsphere existed in 1991/1992 would it have benefited the movement or simply attenuated it? After all, the collage style mash ups of the early zines were important statements for readers, an aesthetic that seems less impactful in blog form."

"In short, marriage should be understood as a task, requiring planning by both partners, as well as study, skills and a will. You’re not picking a man, you’re picking a plan, the plan that you think will help God the most. And there is absolutely no need to resort to sex or alcohol or anything order to discuss these things. What actually works on me is writing me a good long essay about anything. Because marriage is more about communication and relationships than anything else. You can have intimacy without alcohol just by turning the conversation to topics that matter and writing about them."

"As you know I have been raising money to go on a missions trip to Panama this summer! I feel like a brat when I say this, but I have never really had to worry about finances in my life. I am definitely not rich, but I have been blessed with parents who have been willing to pay for college and help support me along the way. When I stepped into this trip and the finances that came with it, I told myself that I don’t want my parents having to pick up the scraps of what I don’t raise. I wanted to raise this money on my own. It was something that I knew I didn’t want to put on them. I sent out many support letters and was really stoked to see what God was going to do. It became prevalent very soon that raising this money was going to be a huge trial. I realized soon that this was not going to be as easy as I thought it would be. This has been by far the most expensive missions trip I’ve been on, which became very overwhelming. I got money here and there and was so thankful but began to grow impatient. I got the idea to make cake pop and sell them for donations which was a huge success! Everybody loved them, and through selling them dorm room to dorm room God really was working on opening me up and getting me to step out of my comfort zone. It was hard and definitely a push for me to do that but so rewarding in the end. God really helped me and pushed me."
"This was a pic I took during a waterfall hiking trip I took with my family on the west side of North Carolina a few weeks ago. It was so beautiful, I thought it would be a nice pic to share with everyone on earth day. Our earth is so beautiful, God has given us such a wonderful place to live."
"We decided to start getting back as the sun was starting to set, but first we had to deal with a huge people-jam. Whilst we were amongst it all, we thought we would never get out. I was very convinced it was a dead-end as there could be no other reason for all these people also struggling to move in the opposite direction to us. 15 minutes of my life wasted later and we were out. I felt successful. On the way back to the bikes I saw a scout stall selling t-shirts which I regret not buying. They said “I crown(in picture form) NL”. I don’t have a t-shirt to signify my stay in the Netherlands and this one seemed very nice in comparison to the ones we would see the next day in Amsterdam. I also want this one in town that says “I rain cloud (in picture form) NL”. However they only stock this in XL and man size. The burden of being a women."
"The parents were there, and they were very nice, very gracious. It was autumn, beautiful, with woods all around us, and we paddled a canoe across this round, icy lake full of small gold leaves that collected along the shore. The family knew every inch of the land. They knew how the hills had formed, how the glacial drifts had created the lake, the names of the earliest white settlers—their ancestors—and before that, the names of the Indians who’d once hunted the land. The house was very old, her grandfather’s house. He had inherited it from his grandfather. The library was filled with old books and pictures of the grandfather with famous people he had known—presidents, diplomats, industrialists. There was this tremendous gravity to the room. Standing in that room, I realized that our two worlds, my friend’s and mine, were as distant from each other as Ken­ya is from Germany. And I knew that if we stayed together I’d eventually live in hers. After all, I’d been doing it most of my life. Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider."
"The book’s legacy is that these ideas have trickled down into public education, where all the white “elites” of American history get their comeuppance. Thomas Jefferson, for instance, may have written the Declaration of Independence and doubled the size of our nation with the Louisiana Purchase, but we all first think of one of this country’s greatest patriots as a slaveholder. As a student of history, I know this is an historical truth and certainly relevant. But is it fair to focus so much on Jefferson’s hypocrisy? After all, I’m pretty sure the self-evident truth that “all men are created equal” has outlasted slavery in this country."
"The thing is, orange is one of those colours that sneaks up and seduces you with its wit, charm, and humorous take on life. It's like Hugh Grant. It's a colour cad that's never around for long but it's fun when it does appear. So I suspect tangerine might take us all by surprise this year. I was watching that poignant Parisian episode of Sex and the City last night (An American Girl in Paris, Part Deux), and there was a fabulous bright orange panelled wall in one of the scenes with Aleksandr Petrovsky. It immediately made me want to repaint our summer library in a cheeky mandarin shade."
"But ultimately, neither pairing was wrong, they were just different. Lost was confusing everybody because it was telling two love stories simultaneously: the classic romance, and the sensational, epic love story. Of course, the additional twist was that the show was telling these stories with the same female character - thus in a way symbolising the conflict in contemporary society between the old and the new, between the beautiful and the amplified. There is a general fear of losing the ""high culture"" in an over-saturated, media crazed society, and postmodernist television is (while brilliant in a lot of ways) dissolving the barrier the low and the high culture. Lost is taking this to a whole new level, by literally staging a battle for dominance between these two types of storytelling, these two different approaches to romance - using the characters Jack and Sawyer as champions for the two sides. Whether Jack and Kate ending up together signals a return to romance as it used to be, or whether it just shows it to be more eternal, lasting and memorable, is up for debate."
"Alex had one of the better character arcs, starting out as Jay’s girlfriend and majorly kicking ass and taking names with him and most of his hookups when he gave her a social disease and cheated on her. She then realized she was a lesbian and had an on-off relationship with Paige for a while. Her mother was also and idiot who dated this deadbeat that ran up their credit and got arrested for embezzlement charges. Forced to make ends meet Alex had to strip! But then idiot mom took her skripper tips and bailed deadbeat bf out of jail. Way to put your child first, Mom. She eventually got written off to stay with a cousin who lived in the boondocks of Canada. Random fun fact: there was a rumor circulating that the chick who played Alex was going to be in a live action movie adaptation of Sailor Moon as one of the Sailor Scouts. Clearly, that didn’t happen."

Fantastic beers to end the evening on, smooth and rich."

In fact, we have to cause them to appreciate the very opposite: that Israel is anything but crazy. That Israel acts aggressively only because it has no chance. It hits people only because it has to. It hits non-dangerous people only in a case of collateral damage, while making immense efforts not to harm them."

A date where a young man in a tuxedo picks the girl up in a car, either driven by the date or the date's parents. There were flowers for the wrist, and pictures taken by both parents. It's a time for memories, memories which will stay with the couple (or at least the girl) for a lifetime."

"By the time baby three came I started working from home because the cost of daycare was outrageous and I truly did want to be home for my children. That was when I put into motion one of my big life goals—writing a book. This took me over a year and that book is under the bed, so to speak, but it showed me I could do it. I then joined my local romance writers’ group and never looked back. Today, I have over 12 books to my name. This year I started my Indie journey and launched my nitty gritty YA stories under a new name (actually it’s my original name-lol) and I’m loving it. The third book in my nitty gritty series, Off Stroke debuts this month on"

"Anyway, here we are on the last day of February -- an extra day, which is a blessing, perhaps, though I am longing for winter to fully retreat (but never wish away days, I know; they are too precious for that). I've had the same hacking cough and sore throat as most of the rest of London, but lucky to have an afternoon with my mother at the Royal Academy's Hockney exhibition, which was glorious, despite the crowds. She was (and is) a very wise guide; and Hockney's landscapes are vivid reminders, amongst other things, of the particular joys of each of the four seasons. I hope that doesn't sound horribly Pollyanna-ish, to anyone who is gripped by the mean reds or wintry blues (I've been there myself), but the London sky was beautiful at six o'clock this evening, when darkness had not yet fallen.

"A few posts back, I asked the question whether or not ivy league college educations were worth it. I stand by my original thought that in this environment, it’s not realistic. Those folks who are coming out of college with impressive degrees from even more impressive colleges aren’t finding jobs any faster than those who are graduating from the rest of the schools. In fact, those with ivy league degrees might be having an even harder time because companies just can’t afford the salaries these graduates are asking for (and deserve, I might add)."

"Across the valley, a crumbling grey edifice: the flint walls of Eynsford Castle. Another English Heritage property, I had planned to take a detour to explore the castle, but unfortunately it was closed on the date of my visit due to structural instability. Built on the site of an earlier Saxon settlement, the castle was constructed in the 1080s by William de Eynsford, and was abandoned after being vandalised in the early 14th century as a result of a feud between the Kirkeby and Criol families. Its only subsequent use was as hunting kennels in the 18th century, such that it remains a relatively undisturbed and well-preserved example of a Norman curtain-wall castle. Despite the lack of public access today – November 5th – there is plenty of activity as the villagers prepare for bonfire night. Not quite Edinburgh Castle at Hogmanay, it is nonetheless a spectacular setting for a fireworks display."

I'm on the lookout for pastel shades in icy tones that suit my skin tone - ice pink, mint, lavender and ice blue - and then I want to wear them altogether! Something in my brain has snapped with the opening of the first daffodils here and I am suddenly craving lots and lots of colour. Or maybe my senses have just been fooled to think that all those sugary shades hitting the stores right now and delighting my eyes are going to fizz on my taste buds and delight my palate instead when I get around to wearing them."

"Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" is currently the internet film community's Rage du Jour. Continuing a battle over the merits of Nolan as a filmmaker that began two years ago with ""The Dark Knight"", this was also one of the few films being released in yet another barren summer movie season that was worth seeing and talking about. Anyone who knows me is probably aware now that I consider The Battle Over Nolan a low point in film discourse on the web, where both sides of the ""debate"" have descended into hyperbolic nonsense as if there was a victory to be won on the matter. His films are often wildly misrepresented to simply fulfill a narrative each side wants to create about his abilities as well as those who disagree with their opinions. Either Nolan is the filmmaking genius who is the heir apparent to Stanley Kubrick or he is a complete hack responsible for the downfall of motion pictures."

Navid thanks Liam for being a good friend to Silver and Liam tells Navid to be there for her. While Silver and Navid are at the hospital, a nurse comes out to ask her some questions before her mammogram. One of the questions asks if she could be pregnant, and Silver doesn’t answer. Navid asks her how she could be pregnant, and she tells him she hooked up with a random guy. Silver says she’ll get tested tomorrow at her doctor’s appointment to make sure. Navid goes over to the bar and tells Liam that Silver didn’t take the mammogram because she may be pregnant."

When the correct hour comes, we meet in the kitchen, where Ben makes Americanos and English muffins. Then he walks the two blocks to his office, and I go to mine, the aforementioned dining room. I untangle the cord to my headphones, put something on repeat (mostly, it’s been Temple of the Dog’s “Hunger Strike”), and smash a mosquito with my copy of Bird by Bird. That book is even more useful than I had given it credit for. A couple of hours later, Ben comes back for lunch. Because it’s very loud here on Planet Hunger Strike, I don’t notice his arrival until he walks into the dining room and I scream. We make lunch. After that, we go back to our desks and work until early evening, when he goes for a run and I go for a walk. At 8:30 pm, no earlier and no later, I make a round of Negronis. Then we cook dinner, and then we do it all over again."

"But Thomas’ apparent strength was also his weakness. When Jesus appeared to the 10 apostles on that first Easter evening, Thomas was for some reason absent. We’re not told why he wasn’t there. Some have speculated that he may have felt that he was strong and didn’t need the fellowship of the others. Others have thought that he may have been disillusioned because Jesus had been killed, and it looked as though the whole Jesus movement was going to end. Perhaps He wondered whether he had been deceived after all. He may even have thought that if the plan was to kill Jesus, then the disciples would be the next to go. It was safer not to be near the other disciples."

"The reality reflected in the documents from the Abbottabad compound is that bin Laden had been exiled by the leadership of al-Qaeda because he had come to be seen as a loose cannon who was a danger to the organization. The train of events that led to bin Laden's holing up in the compound in Abbottabad began in August 2003, in a small village in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, near the fabled caves of Tora Bora where he led a battle against US Special Forces in December 2001. It was there that the leadership of al-Qaeda conducted a series of extraordinary meetings on its most pressing problem: how to ease bin Laden out of his leadership role in the organization."
"In the “beginning,” that which is called in mystic phraseology Cosmic Desire” evolves into absolute Light. Now light without any shadow would be absolute light—in other words, absolute darkness—as physical science seeks to prove. That shadow appears under the form of primordial matter, allegorized—if one likes—in the shape of the Spirit of Creative Fire or Heat. If, rejecting the poetical form and allegory, science chooses to see in this the primordial Fire-Mist, it is welcome to do so. Whether one way or the other, whether Fohat or the famous FORCE of Science, nameless, and as difficult of definition as our Fohat himself, that Something “caused the Universe to move with circular motion,” as Plato has it; or, as the Occult teaching expresses it:"
"3:16-17 – Theophylact draws a typological connection between the Spirit descending on Christ and the dove returning with an olive twig to the ark. It’s a connection worth pondering and admiring, though I’m hesitant to read it into the text. At the same time, this being the Gospel according to Matthew (aimed at a primarily Jewish audience), it is possible that Matthew had this in mind in his framing of the narrative."
"In order to save money, Fox and his family have learned to cut losses by investing in a variety of cash crops—corn, wheat and beans. By diversifying their crops, if one crop goes down in price in the market and become less valuable, Fox and his family can rely on one of the other crops to do well. They also fix their own tractors or other machinery without hiring outside help and have also made profits by selling cattle."
"And now it's a great spot for riding. I got a small group of friends together yesterday and did a 30-mile loop through Chileno Valley and back along Spring Hill. (And yes, the hills are just as bad -- if not slightly worse -- on a bike. At one point, I really wanted to get off and walk, but I was worried that if I stopped, I'd topple over into the road and get hit by a car. So I just kept pedaling. And grunting. And pedaling.)"

"When we read Proverbs 31, we need to remember to jump ahead to the New Testament. Jesus - not a list of rules – makes a woman into a Proverbs 31 woman. He takes a controlling woman and teaches her to put others before themselves. He indwells the lazy woman and provides her with purpose and perseverance. He gives her the mind of Christ and instills wisdom in her over time. He breathes warmth into her cold heart and helps her become compassionate. He gives her strength in her weakness. He gives her dignity in her shame. The real Proverbs 31 woman is simply a Jesus woman."
"Oxfordshire’s ArtWeeks are kicking off soon and I am involved with two exhibitions this year in different ways.

"Today our nation is full of compromising believers… they lie… they cheat… they deny Jesus… they are full of greed… they live like the unredeemed… They have poisoned the springs of water… They have muddied the waters. Paul strongly wrote in 2 Corinthians 6: 17-18, “Therefore, come out from them and separate yourselves from them, says the Lord. Don’t touch their filthy things, and I will welcome you. And I will be your Father, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord” (NLT). Many Christians feel that God has alienated Himself from them… and that they are not received by God as a family member. If you feel this way… Have you joined yourself to something you shouldn’t have? Have you made any wrong compromises?"
"David Gorski writes of the era when the germ theory was first developed:"
"So after things went really well with our move and everything else, I started to get complacent. I began sewing more and more, and spending less time interacting with my children. I mean, I'm still around, and I listen to them play together and run interference all the time, but I don't get down and play with them very much. I started thinking that going to pick up Breanne from school counted as some sort of outing with my kids. I spent more time online than I should, just checking Facebook and Pinterest. I feel like even though I'm kind of trying to get my life in order and do fun things with my kids, I'm just constantly frustrated by my lack of organization and energy."

We all have a choice in this. The politicians have a choice in how they behave, interact, communicate and vote. This is our opportunity to make a different choice than the ones made leading up to this past week. I wonder if our leaders will seize this moment and see that they can start anew? I will intend that they do!"

Executed it by cooking and freezing most of my food the night before travel. This allowed the frozen food to act almost as ice and keep everything else in my cooler cold."

"So what is a young couple with low egg(low quality?) and poor morphology to do? My doctor presented a few options that aligned exactly with what I wanted to try anyway. We both agreed to try 3 rounds of Clomid/IUI before moving onto IVF. I hope I respond to Clomid, I really do. I have very regular cycles and a noticeable LH surge, so I DO most likely O, at least that’s a plus. The Clomid from what I gather will make me stimulate more eggs then normal. More chances is always cool with me! Clomid carries a 10% chance of twins, double awesome! I’d be happy if I get pregnant with triplets for craps sake! At this point as many kids I can get done in one cycle is a major plus."

"I went to see it with my husband and my in-laws (who are visiting from Oregon right now!) and it was SO good. I was a little hesitant to go see this movie because I had heard that it was a tear-jerker, and I'm not always a fan of sad/heavy movies, even though it's rare that I actually cry during a film. I ended up bawling through a good 1/3 of this movie, but would still very highly recommend it because it's such a beautiful example of how a film can make you feel such intense emotions. Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close embodies the ups and downs of the human experience, and I thought every aspect of the movie was very well-done. (I cannot believe that the kid, Thomas Horn, who played the main character is not nominated for an Oscar because he did an amazing job) The film is nominated for the Oscar for best picture, so if you're like me and you like to try to see some of the nominated movies before the Academy Awards, this is a must-see."

"Be proactive. Eat as soon as you notice your hunger. Sleep. Yes, there will be times when you won't be able to get as much sleep as you need. But do make sure to sleep when the kids are sleeping. If you do choose to stay up for hours after they go to bed, don't complain to them about how exhausted you are. Take showers. Bring the kids in with you if they are tiny, or put on a movie if it's safe to leave them alone for a few minutes. Use the bathroom in the quiet moments, instead of waiting until you are about to burst. You will be better at everything if you are not needy."

"It’s easy to boil this down to something like “Get help,” or “Raise awareness of mental illness,” or “Get therapy and/or psychiatric medicine,” or “Hang in there for your family and friends.” But it’s not so easy to know those things when you’re in the middle of any one of the bad things that happen to people every day. Some people have more to deal with in life than others and some people take things harder than others do. But I’ve always believed that what’s good about life outweighs what’s bad, and it breaks my heart that so many people can’t see that."

"But not content with taking advantage of the Afrikaner-created wealth, the blacks began a terroristic campaign by the African National Congress that killed thousands. Where was their Gandhi? They bombed public places, mined roads killing innocent civilians and sabotaged productive infrastructure. Although the government reacted to this, most deaths were caused by black-on-black violence. A particularly barbaric murder method was approved of by the wife of Nelson Mandela -- the necklacing, a summary execution carried out by forcing a rubber tire, filled with gasoline, around a victim's chest and arms, and setting it on fire. This was used against opponents in internecine ANC warfare."
"His writings explain the prayer journey, usually by way of analogy – after all, there are no human words to describe the divine. He wrote about the detachments and purifications needed to begin and continue the ascent up the mountain of prayer, the dark night of the soul, and the joy and fulfillment expressed in the spiritual canticle and the living flame of God’s love. In contemporary terms, these four works by St. John of the Cross talk about “letting go and letting God.” They describe the growing relationship between a human being and God, all occurring within the soul. “Know you not that you are God’s temple and that His Spirit dwells within you.”"

Jews have a double obligation because it is also a mitzva in the Torah."

"William had been married six times in twelve years, and had more children than he could shake a stick at. He had an overwhelming love affair with onions. They called him the onionater. He would eat onions like everyone else eats an apple. In the mornings, he would stop by Dairy Queen to pick up some of their famous breakfast gravy and biscuits. When he arrived at the P.D. it was an event. The other officers were always anticipating the unusual breakfast of the day. William would prepare for his meal by pulling an onion out of his pocket and cutting it up into the gravy. He kept a jar of pickles in the fridge in his office. He would pour himself a small cup of pickle juice and add one pickle into his gravy. He was a great diet tool for the dispatchers and the other officers. The man has a sick sack of taste buds. Everyone in the station wondered if he even had any taste buds. William would then proceed to put anything on the table on top of his gravy and biscuits. Packets of condiments were always added to the mixture. It didn’t matter what it was, ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard. Those watching would gag as William smacked his lips around his delicious breakfast."

"This tasty product of Lake Nicaragua is called Sopa de Pescado(Fish Soup). It’s wonderful how the whole fish appears to be swimming. I’m not sure what produces the yellow/orange color. The dish was delicious even with the work involved (picking bone after bone out). I’ll be honest; this is not a dish that is available to the typical Nicaraguan. I got it in a tourist area on Ometepe, at a restaurant/hotel owned by a Nicaraguan family and cooked by the older woman of the house. It cost about $6. Most locals on Ometepe don’t earn that much in a day. Pondering upon the economic contrast between tourists and locals here on Ometepe reinforces the fact that life can be so unfair. Here is another fresh water fish from Lake Nicaragua. I was informed by the little girl who served it to me that it’s called “Pescado con Salsa” While eating this $4 plate on a picnic table outside of a home that sits right on the lake, the jovial man who pulled up on his motorbike with a beer in hand, explained to me that this Tilapia was caught in his back yard the day before.

I don’t know how I feel about Augusta. I think it would have been really cool to be called Gus as a girl or even Gussie. My great-great aunt was Augusta Marie and they called her Aggie…That wouldn’t have been so bad. But,I think Aunt Aggie was a lush.

Relentless: that’s the nickname of the motorcycle race coming up in Northern Ireland this month. I like that, as it fits the relentlessness of this urge I have to get this story down."

"Upstairs are two artists’ studios. In one is a textile artist, creating hats, scarves and other items to be worn, while the other is home to an artist exploring drawing practices. It is always interesting to see behind the scenes, to see how people organise their work spaces and explore, develop and create art work. It was a pity they weren’t working, but it did give us an opportunity to snoop about."

"Before sitting down to write this I did a bit of research on the ""origin of language"" and find I am in good company. It seems when and how language was developed has been debated for over a hundred years. At one time the subject became so heated the discussion was banned. There are several circulating theories, one being we are genetically encoded. I am not an academian, anthropologist, archeologist nor am I a linguistist; I am simply a lover of words (though probably a poor user of words)."
"Had a jacket potato for tea after clearing around the microwave area and scrubbing the microwave clean as it could get, Mr N hoovered, madam E tidied her bedroom as she hates the hoovers noise and the son was at school practising for a food culinary competition by cooking some lovely mixed veg in a brown bread (he made that too) surround, brought it home, it were right tasty, nice one son!"
"Anyone who has ever taught knows that if your student's eyes are not on you, then they probably aren't listening. Yet a pair of peepers could be staring right at you while the brain behind it is only thinking about a cheeseburger. Such are the ways of learning. It takes a great deal of hard work and discipline from the teacher AND the listener. I always hated saying to my students, ""Pay attention!"" or ""Listen while I'm talking."" I began to tell them, ""Eyes on me"" which eventually evolved to, ""Eyeballs!"" I always get a smile or laugh from my piano students when I say this, but they definitely know that it's time to LISTEN UP."

I just finished watching The Search for Spock and was rather appalled that they would kill off Christopher Lloyd’s character. Other than that, it was a rather kickass movie."

"While in studio with Street in January 1987 re-recording ""Sheila Take A Bow"", the band took the time to lay down a couple takes of this track (prior to the main Strangeways, Here We Come LP sessions in April 1987). What sets this apart from the Strangeways version is the pronounced reggae-ness of the instrumentation (no, there aren't any steel drums). Goddard says the first two takes of this from the January '87 sessions featured this Jamaican interpretation, which we have here, and Moz's vocal is a bit rough around the edges (of course he'd tighten it up later on)."

"Unfortunately for our leaders, and for their dangerous daydream, history has a way of repeating itself, and dawn will come no matter how you may cling to a dream. They should fear for their dream will not come true, and it will soon be revealed for what it is. It is then that reality may cast them into the void, as it did to the last queen of France."
"Hubert Ozwell is Asbel's younger brother. As a kid he is meek, soft spoken, and intelligent. Although the youngest of the two, it is stated that he would be better suited to be Lord than Asbel. His parents decide to have him adopted by the Ozwell family in Strahta so he and Asbel wouldn't fight over the Lordship of Lhant. Seven years later, he has become harsh and untrusting even to his own brother due to his parents ""abandoning"" him. He returns as a Strahtan lieutenant when the Windor agrees to the Strahtan military to occupy Lhant."

"They have been like this since they were little. They will argue with each other like crazy then not ten minutes later are laughing and playing and having fun. I just hope they don't continue this pattern in high school. I hope that they can learn how to work out their differences without yelling at each other. How to be not only sisters but best friends.

"Sometimes we think so much about what we don’t want to lose that we forget what we really have. We take people we know, friends, and family for granted. We think (without really thinking about it) that they will be there for us forever. Now I’m not just thinking about the fact that no one lives forever, but that people they come and go in our lives. At some point we might stop, and realize that everyone are gone. But where?"
"CV: Well, it's all I know. I don't really know what it would be to do someone else's family, or some other such story. I have photographed some special people on assignment for magazines, for example I did a Newsweek cover story on men with Chronic Depression. That's just a few hours with a person."
"I have decided that I'm off women too. No, I haven't changed sides, regardless of what some people may think already. I just need much more time to sort myself out - with that in mind I am going to move away for a year. I will still pursue my photography as I really enjoy it and believe there can be a future in it. But I haven't learnt as much as I expected here, so more effort and more like minded people to grow and learn from required."
"It was a long road getting there though, let me tell you! I decided to whip up the batter and let it sit in the fridge overnight after a botched experiment with making blueberry ganache for an upcoming foodie challenge given by The Daring Kitchen, and failed infusion of lavender in cream had gotten the better of me. Convinced that my kitchen mojo was waning, but not wanting it to get the better of me, I set everything aside and pulled out some dusty faith out of the cupboard, dusted it off and got to work."

It's sooooo nice. The only thing I could think to do with a drapey jersey was apply another tried and tested pattern from the batwing family that I've been using a lot recently. It's bascially a slightly more refined version of the Poker top, but this fabric is far more stable. It feels so nice to wear, and I envisage wearing it with my black Jenny pencil skirt or some killer black capri pants whenever I get round to making some.

"A core group of us middlers played there every single weekend night. There was JC who acted as the club’s runner, banker, bouncer, booker, and comedian. There was Niko who ran around with, literally, an ivory tusk in his ear. He was an enormous black man with a teddy bear heart, plain and simple. There was Joe who was a dyed in the wool Irish-American from Brooklyn, probably going back several generations, and, as such, he seemed more Italian. There was Jay a newlywed from the South who lived with his wife in a hipster part of Brooklyn, which he half thumbed his nose at, regularly. And that was pretty much it. Those were the main players. There were lots of ancillary ones, as well, that gave the place color, but mainly these characters set the scene. Oh, and there was, US – the three, female, comedians, the only ones who JC deemed funny enough to play the room – me, Rayanne, and Miranda. A black, a Jew, and an Irish woman walk into a…well, you see what I mean, we were almost a living satire – the three of us. It was fantastic. You can not re-create the kind of vibe that we had at The Barrio. Those were magical times. Magical, magical times."

"Jacob Miller is an inner-city boy who hates being black and poor. He reluctantly assists his little brother Peewee in making a black snowman from the filthy snow in the back alley. The figure comes alive after they unknowingly drape him in a fragment of the magical kente , a cloth worn by African storytellers for hundreds of years. The snowman challenges Jacob’s outlook on life by telling him all the wonderful things that are black, and mysteriously conjuring forth brave heroes from African tribal tradition. When Peewee is trapped inside a burning building, the snowman shows Jacob a way to save his brother while exhorting the boy to believe in himself. Using mystical elements and the power of the past, Mendez, in his first book, weaves a stirring tale of Jacob’s transformation from a bitter victim of his situation into a proud fighter for his life. Byard’s haunting color drawings bring to life not only the snowman; they successfully portray the many contrasts between Jacob’s dour moods, Peewee’s optimism, the dingy apartment and the eerie parade of stately African tribesmen."
"Second, and most vital, Jeremy Hunt only followed the OFT/Ofcom advice when it was helpful to the bid. The one time Ofcom “caused trouble” by advising him to refer the bid to the Competition Commission (which, as an ex-OFT competition expert, I can tell you was a no-brainer), Jeremy Hunt ignored Ofcom. He initially said he was minded to refer, then delayed his decision, sought Undertakings in Lieu, which he accepted and changed his position."

"Known by his Americanized first name of Roy, Nushida was a pretty small guy, about 5'-2"" and just over 100 lbs, but he made up for his diminutive stature with an impressive assortment of curve balls. A teammate on the Senators called him ""one of the smartest pitchers he had ever seen"" and crowds loved to watch the little pitcher strike out the much larger players he faced. Nushida played around the semi-pro circuit on the island and in 1922 he came to America with the barnstorming Honolulu All-Stars. Recognizing that the West Coast's burgeoning Nisei baseball circuit, Roy Nushida decided to stay in Northern California and for the next 9 years became a fixture of the Japanese-American semi-pro leagues in between working as a salesman in Stockton. With the vast Japanese market so far untapped by any Pacific Coast League team, Moreing and the Senators had a marketing goldmine. When Nushida was signed by the team, the Senators were barely holding onto third place statistically unable to get close to the first or second slot. With Sacramento about to embark on their last trip around the PCL circuit it was the perfect time to bring out their Asian rookie to create a media buzz and put those Japanese fans in the stands from LA to Seattle. Changing his first name from Roy back to his Japanese name of Kenso, Nushida began his tour of the league."

"In a big bowl, mix together the flour, fruit, salt and spices. Beat the egg into the milk/butter/zest/yeast, then pour all the liquid ingredients into the dry.

Perhaps the longer fluid lines to link front and rear suspension provided the discovery, rather than the very short left to right linking pipework.

"When you are single, what’s the most prominent aspect about yourself you think about? Your appearance, right? Men lift weights, and women cover themselves in makeup so men can’t see who you really are. (There are many other things which apply here, but I do not wish to explain them all. If you take offense in my idle description: I don’t care.) You appearance is just a mask and your goal, while single, is to make yourself look better than you really do. My point is that everybody (and allow me to generalize here) wants to be more attractive to have the chance of enticing a good-looking mate. Whether or not this mate is fit for you is a different story (see SI/IOAIN: Part Two). But physical attraction seems to be highest on the list for most people in seeking a romantic partner."

"As I said at the beginning of this piece, what struck me most about the film is that it is something of a “revisionist”-revisionist Western, essentially circling back to the Classical approach, both in its themes and in its style. The Coens make masterful use of long shots, encompassing the beauty of the scenery, and allowing the action to play out in well-staged action scenes that take full advantage of the choreography of the actors within the frame. The beauty of the American west is captured in a series of breathtaking shots that take on an epic quality rarely seen in contemporary films."

"As a geography teacher, I am happy to say that all my students from school know lots of things about earthquakes, and in a weird way, I hope that this will help and encourage them when it comes to revision for their GCSE Geography exams, nothing like practical and hands on experience to put learning into context! Especially since all schools have been cancelled today. Myself and my neighbour were actually out at the bazaari yesterday and felt a few tinyshakes. Had we not been together, we probably would have both thought that we had an inner ear problem, but because we were both experiencing the same thing, we guessed an earthquake might come soon as tremors are often the sign of more to come. So I knew this morning when things started shaking a little in the house and my usually very lazy cat and dog suddenly jumped off the bed and looked at each other, before deciding it was ok to return back to their sleeping positions a few minutes afterwards. Animals often have a sixth sense for these things. Then my neighbour called to confirm that it was indeed an earthquake."

"The trail is actually on top of an old (and I’m talking many years) landfill site (I know, GROSS) that was covered over and “beautified”, if you can visualize that. It’s really not a bad place at all, just ignore the occasional odor wafting by (which might be from the muddy riverbanks) lol. In all seriousness though, the trail was quiet, despite the music in my ears, with the occasional sound of a few birds, distant cars and the water rushing through the open causeway gates (yes, I stopped to listen, during the couple times I actually paused my workout and stopped to take a few pics). The air was fresh, cool, devoid of the exhaust from distant traffic. I even watched a plane overhead, ascending into the twilit sky, oblivious to everything below it. I wondered, briefly, where they might be going, then picked up the pace and continued on to my destination, again stopping for a minute or two to take a pic of the bridge that spans a stream of water leading to the Petitcodiac River (more affectionately known by locals as “The Chocolate River”). After the trail bridge, it was back under the road bridge to get to the parking lot and ball fields. Some kids had graffiti-ed the underside of this road bridge, but it added color to its belly, making for a decent picture. I don’t mind tasteful graffiti."

If there's one thing that fuels a good man-crush in me, it's a good quiff. And John Travolta's is a very good quiff.

I have hope that people will get past the issue of sexual orientation. We should worry: is this person honest, what kind of human being is this? It is inhumane to mistreat people for their sexual orientation. It is our job to educate people and pull them out of the dark. You should not judge a person by their color, or if they wrap their head or not, or who they date. People’s personal lives are their business.

They don't heed the advice of others, and sacrifice common sense for obsession. Though the goal may be noble, a Persistent's way of pursuing if is often less than honorable."

The book is less invasive. A stranger is easier to agree with my rationale. But does it really help when things get sticky?"
"Although a lot of these companies have become more professional and adept at delivering products in large volumes, their ability to scale up an organization that can work collaboratively has not kept pace. Their rigorous, linear processes for bringing new products to market ensure rapid commercialization but create too many hand-offs where insights are lost and trade-offs for efficiency are promoted."

We loved the baths and can see why the locals frequent them. As far as our issues went, it just goes to show you that even the most prepared tourists will face challenges traveling. Anyway, it’s the awkward and difficult experiences that make the best memories in the end. Does anyone have an awkward tourist moment to share? I’d love to hear it!"
"Some days it just doesn't pay to enter the kitchen. I had the recipe for this bread for about a month before I made it. My first attempt not so successful. The dough went together beautifully. The first proofing, great. The second, no problem. Then Rigby's technology teacher emailed us to let us know about her antics in class, and things went down hill from there. After picking Rigs up from school. (She sent a text stating she was staying for the after school program, despite the fact I was waiting in front of the school for her) I opened a bottle of wine and started to shape the bread into loaves. After rolling out the dough, brushing on butter, and sprinkling with cinnamon and sugar, it was time for the final proofing. Everything was going well. The oven was preheating, I was enjoying my glass of wine, and was busy getting dinner together. Dinner went on the table and I was enjoying my second glass of wine. Once dinner was over and Rigby was doing clean up, I slid the bread into the oven, set a timer, and then took my glass of wine into the living room to hang out with hubby. When I remembered the bread in the oven, it was cremated. To the point the raisins turned to ash in your mouth."

"Mr. Brooks (Costner) is a serial killer, and there’s the first draw that makes this thing more interesting than your average cop thriller. This isn’t like Dexter where the hero is killing for a justifiable reason, no – Mr. Brooks just kills random people who haven’t done anything, and only because he is addicted to it. You could make the argument that his want to stop makes him a more likable character, but the ending of the movie squashes that one, and I think the fact that the film asks you to try and root for this guy is part of the challenge and the fun. He is aided by his sarcastic, murderous alter-ego (Hurt), appearing to him in spirit-form, urging him to kill and often being the little devil on his shoulder. Except there really isn’t an angel on his shoulder at all."

"In the current system one is actually able to earn a college scholarship based on their ability in a particular sport.

There are the few exceptions to the rule where you have the odd kid who excels at a particular sport coming from a less privileged background and thus for him/her this may be their only access to education which is quite a risky path we have currently carved out in our system for some individuals to actually stand an equal chance in this world, as one slip, one unexpected injury could spell the downfall for that individual and have a massive impact on the rest of their life. In an Equal Money System Education will simply be a birth-right for all and no more just a option for those with Money.

You ask your friend when she gets back, about her trip and when she tells you about it, you smirk unknowingly thinking about the amount of sex they might have had. You attest her as a sex addict who is just trying to cover her deeds up by telling false stories. Why do you do that?"

"Dump for your personal reading, if not for your church book club or any Christian education class from high school and up. In particular, if you are in a denomination that talks about the conservatism of the churches in Africa, this book is for you and yours.

A body that is schizophrenic about social issues and divides against itself? We cannot undo that we have been made one in Christ because it was not our doing. Thus, we are God’s mission- a mission of relationship and reconciliation. The goal of that mission for us, according to Zink, is to learn to spot grace. Everywhere. Even at the dump."

"I had done a search on the internet for pineapple sorbet, and even read the recipes in the manual that came with my ice cream maker, but when I tried the most common recipe I found myself a little disappointed with the results. The majority of those recipes called for a simple syrup made of sugar and water and then mixing lemon juice into the watered down pineapple mixture. Blah… It just didn’t taste right. So, I made my way back to the grocery store for another fresh pineapple and some pineapple juice, to try out my new idea! I figured, if you’d normally add a sugar syrup to pureed pineapple, then it would probably not be much different to use juice instead. Texturally, it came out just the same as the other, but it tasted so much better, and had pure pineapple flavor! I made some chocolate pineapple garnishes to go with my sorbet, but feel free to use any chocolate you’d like with yours. Like a drizzle of chocolate syrup... YUM!!"
"At the cusp of the technological Singularity, the Artilect War is raging. Cosmists, intent on creating strong artificial intelligence, subjugate the rejective and regressive Terrans, who want to halt the evolution of humans.

The Terrans outnumber the Cosmists, and many universities, laboratories, and think-tanks are bombed. But the Cosmists out-think the Terrans, and accelerating technology stacks the odds in evolution’s favor. Mass Terran suicides are common."

"For the craft, I took a couple different ideas and put them together. I had tons of leftover plastic eggs from when we used to have a big Easter egg hunt. I bought large yellow pom poms (unfortunately I had to buy several assorted bags for this, but we’ll use them later.) Each kid had a pom pom, two google eyes, and a little foam triangle for a beak. They glued these on and while they dried, they decorated the eggs and a foam bowl with Easter stickers. They shredded green tissue paper and glued it into the bowl. Then they attached pipe cleaner handles to the foam bowls and ended up with an Easter basket. The pom pom chicks went into the plastic eggs and were placed in the basket. The end result: an Easter basket with an egg which, when opened, produces a cute baby chick! I wish I had pictures but I guess I forgot my camera that day, but the picture below is what the chicks looked like."

Now these jobs are largely staffed by immigrants undoubtedly using them as a means to obtain permanent residency status so that they can eventually leave it and compete with Canadians in the labour market for jobs Canadians want to do. This is very evident in Toronto and the surrounding area."

"Now plenty of not so fun things were going on around me as a kid, but my parents did such a good job of sheltering or protecting me from those things.

But Head Office was more concerned with getting money into seats where key officers were candidates, rather than looking at where the most votes were likely to come from! By this time we were into an annual income of something like £2 million and yet branches and groups had to give up money to finance the European elections. Head Office should have paid for it and left the branches and the groups to conserve their finances for local elections.

Last month and the month before that, he only needed a coupe of bottles to get through the rough patch, and he eats about 4 ounces of Gerber a day with his oats (well, I serve him that much-- he eats about half.

I think about my Aunt J. and how she really has had a rough life. So many difficult things as a mother that she has dealt with. It seems tragically unfair. Yet at the same time I know that God has long worked to prepare her heart for the rough road ahead for her beautiful Maggie. She has learned how to embrace challenges, how to appreciate small victories and how to keep hope alive in desperate circumstances. Could you please pray for her? My Mommy heart aches for my Aunt."

"And, as a final swipe at the trope, let me ask this question: who the hell is designing this zombie plague? Why? If the objective is to create a devastating biological weapon, why make zombies? A hyped-up version of the flu, anthrax, or smallpox would kill *far* more people, be easier to deploy, and, what’s more, give you an easier time when you came in to mop-up and claim territory (which is what all good weapons are supposed to let you do, you know). If the objective is to make some kind of super-human soldiers, why make it transferrable? You don’t want your opponents in a conflict to ‘catch’ your super-power, do you? If the objective is to infliltrate or control society, why make zombies? Zombies are freaking useless slaves. Why not simply infiltrate society with very *appealing* creatures and take control that way. Society is compelled by smiles and pretty faces, but repelled by blood-stained, drooling monsters."

Consider also the fact that the holy Jewish Talmud looks on a Gentile woman as a piece of raw meat, to be used and abused at will.

"So if the root canal wasn't enough financial stress, some boat gear is acting up. The hydraulic cylinder that controls the tension in some rigging that holds the mast up started leaking around the seal. I did some research and also with some advice from an acquaintance that runs a sailboat rigging company, I found that ""sure, any hydraulic shop can overhaul them. They just use standard seals"". So I took the cylinder to the only local hydraulic shop for overhaul. They said that they could get on it in a few days, but after eight days I called them on Thursday. They said that they would get on it that afternoon. That afternoon I got a call. They could not get it apart. The threads have galled. So with a race pending next weekend, I retrieved it and reinstalled it on the boat tonight. Hopefully it won't leak to much. After the race, I will probably send it to a ""Authorized repair facility"". And if they can't repair it, then I will price out a new one, OUCH!"

Their world involve newness, and wonder, and freedom, and possibility, and joy. And so many adults do the exact opposite to their children - they make them live in a world of experience and training, and realism, and restriction, and probability, and structure - mostly designed for the convenience of the parent, not for the benefit of the miraculous child.

I came across a small town called Playa Flamingo, the sand was brown and the beach not all that exciting given there were fishing boats about. What was wonderful though, was that you could walk in either direction north or south and find more beaches. Playa Conchal was likely one of the most beautiful I found in Costa Rica, and definitely the most unique. Rather than sand, it was made up of crushed sea shells that had been made so incredibly smooth by the passing tide, you wouldn’t believe it. Every shell reflecting the sun like no sand ever could.

A few inches deep, and several feet wide...3 big collections that were apparently left behind by what must have been an especially powerful high tide...and this collection of shells was found nowhere else on the beach...and we walked several blocks and never even came across a sign that anything like this would be possible on this day (I had not seen a collections of shells on LBI in a couple years, and that was immediately after a severe Nor'eastern that coincided with a New Moon)"

"I started arena the bold adapted away, and was afraid at how brittle and ablaze the animation were — Complete Aphotic looks as acceptable as you bethink it looking, and bigger than it in actuality looked — but what in actuality bent my absorption was how abundant the faces were. While a lot of of the graphical updates are artlessly cast new hi-res textures to alter the originals, appearance models were in actuality rebuilt with college polygon counts. Even Jo's duke and gun in first-person are remodeled. You can in actuality achieve out the abstracts on the faces, and appearance such as aperture and eyes are able-bodied defined. This abominably makes cinemas a little annoying because, like the original, the faces are all changeless and there is no lip sync."

"So when I said that communists have murdered 100,000,000 people in the last century by starving, executing, or freezing them to death in gulags, that doesn’t actually count, but when an African kid dies of malaria because angsty urban American liberals got DDT banned to protect bird’s eggs, that’s the fault of capitalism… Gotcha."
"All fun and games until someone loses an eye."
"It wasn’t always this way, but I have a bit of a soft spot for Abou Diaby. When he’s got the ball it looks like he’s made of superior stuff to those battling in vain to get it off him. It’s not just his height, his whole shape his different. Lithe yet sturdy. And seriously, has anyone noticed the freakishly long distance between his ankle and knee?"
"For now, I’ll do my best to get eight or more hours of sleep a night, stay hydrated, eat three well-balanced meals a day and attempt not to freak out. And if I do start to freak out?"
"The Court of Appeal's decision confirms that speculative, wide ranging uses identified at the point of patent filing are not enough to satisfy the requirement for industrial applicability. The patent needs to disclose specific and practical ways of exploiting the invention. As a minimum, there must be a real likelihood that a proposition made regarding the function of the product is true. It seems that discovering a nucleotide sequence encoding for a human protein and being able to show that the protein concerned has some common homology with known proteins may satisfy Article 57, but whether it does or not is case-dependent and in particular depends upon how well established the functions of the other members of the family are."

"We got to Blackmons house in Tallapoosa around 5 am. It was dark one hour ride from airport to their house. Kids only got 2 hours of sleep and that is it.

Will they be sad? Confused? Upset? Scared? I know my vet will take good care of them but they will spend their day inside a kennel. I just have to keep telling myself they are safe and they will be ok. But at this point I will just add it to the list of things I will cry about! HA! So I just ask God to give me strength and give my animals peace as we all make it thru the next week!"

After a lot of research and weighing options, I have decided to go with rabbits."

"Yep, things are really going well. We anticipate the things that aren't will be eventually. Until then, we just need the patience and understanding that it takes to help Jacob continue to develop in a healthy way. We trust that Jacob is happy here with us.

"It had become very much colder. It was a brilliant, starry night. There was no moon and I have never seen the stars shine brighter; they appeared to stand right out of the sky, sparkling like cut diamonds. A very light haze, hardly noticeable, hung low over the water. I have spent much time on the ocean, yet I have never seen the sea smoother than it was that night; it was like a mill pond, and just as innocent looking, as the great ship quietly rippled through it."
"Cut up denim for a rag-rug. Which never made it out of the carrier bag. You cut/rip into strips and braid together. Then you wind into a cartwheel and stitch in place. Yeah, that's the THEORY. Again, this is a 1990s project, I'm sure."

"It may be also that David recognized in Joab something a little closer to home. David, whom God would not allow to build a temple because of all the blood on his hands (1 Chronicles 22:8), shared with Joab this propensity toward violence. In fact, one of Joab’s most heinous murders was a personal favor for the king (2 Samuel 11:14-17)."

"I think the model is relatively elegant, but I have one problem with it: I don’t think the universe is on an infinitely repeating loop. Sure, I think the universe’s own dissolution will lead to its eventual rebirth, but I don’t think the new universe will be precisely the same. Every day begins with the sun rising in the East, but it’s not as though every day is the same as the last."
"I've chosen to spotlight Tess Hilmo. Tess's debut novel, With a Name like Love, launched just a couple of weeks ago. Tess's writing is beautiful and her characters are amazingly vivid. There are five daughters in the Love family, and I am certain I could identify any one of them just by a line of dialogue. The language is rich and descriptive; the plot is full of mystery and tension. I don't normally read MG or historical, but I loved every minute of this incredible book."

"My blame dropped, my anger dropped, my fight against the body-shaking, soul-shattering rejection completely dropped. I was no longer fighting the outcome to this situation. Even more profoundly, I was no longer fighting myself for feeling like I did. It was just simply what it was. Peace enveloped me. I wish I’d known this for my first experience of heartbreak – but I am so deeply relieved I have learned it for my second meeting with loss."
"As we are a monthly challenge, not a weekly one, we know that people see the challenge on the 1st, intend to play along, but then forget about us with all the weekly challenges that come along in between. So from now on, we thought we'd do a little mid-month inspirational post each month, to remind you what the challenge is while you still have time to play along - particularly as there is the chance of a prize every month now for our favourite card."

Last year he claimed it was his ""luckiest"" birthday ever with the date falling on 11.11.11. :) But regardless of it being lucky or not, Liam has always had a deep interest in knowing more about the day itself. Remembrance Day is a favourite subject of his, at school."

"In addition to all the freedom and flexibility, Sudbury schools also provide an ongoing, mixed-age community in which young people share responsibility for maintaining a culture of respect. Having such a space outside the family sphere gives our students the benefits of a diverse and vibrant “home away from home,” stretching them to try new things, new ways of thinking and being. In this dynamic, Sudbury students develop superlative interpersonal skills. There are constant opportunities to assess and regulate one’s behavior, and to work with people with whom one doesn’t already have a familial bond. Shy kids learn to speak up for themselves; overly assertive kids learn when and how to hold back. All eventually come into their own in the most thrilling ways imaginable."

"This is not to say we aren’t teachable or willing to listen to constructive criticism. But there are times when naysayers and mean voices (including our own) only serve to defeat us, to battle against what God wants for our lives. Even as I write these truths, I feel an opening of freedom. Even if others don’t like me. Even if I receive mean emails. Even when I’m tired and discouraged. I can still have freedom knowing that Jesus loves me."

"I say take the negative energy they send, and use it positively by giving God the praises where you stand because you have something the enemy wants inside you or envy. Because you are the child of a King who conquered Satan at His best. I will not embrace negativity with vengeance, belittling or sarcasm, especially when someone is displaying love. It is amazing when you love others and display that love, they return it with bitterness. They are the type of people who smile on the outside, and despise you on the inside. They are not being real. They cater to your misery and pain."

"In my ‘politically correct’ and over polite congregation (also prevalent in today’s society,) ‘No’ is a word we hate to use. We are uncomfortable with it. We push against it. We try to soften its harsh effect on the recipient; we pretend it’s really not a ‘No’; or we change our answer to ‘Maybe’ or just to not hurt the other’s feelings, our ‘No’ ends up – a ‘Yes’."

"It's all Sandra's fault. She's currently doing posts about her family history and recently did a rather impressive one about an Easter outing, complete with bonnets, in Warley (Halifax) about 1910. The clothes fascinated me and it reminded me of this photo of my mum and grandma. The back of the picture says it dates from 1943 and I think it was taken in Bradford. (The family's home city.)"

"And until that day,"
"Years later, when our son Adam was born, my husband began speaking to him only in Arabic. So Adam has a much better understanding of Arabic than I do. And he is learning to read and write it in school, which I am thrilled about. It is not easy to learn any language when you are in your mid-50s, and certainly not a language as difficult as Arabic. I have two books to help me learn the language and lots of human helpers as well! Everyone tries to help me with new words and phrases. I try to speak it as much as I can and I ask questions about how to say things in Arabic, but it isn’t happening as quickly as I would like. If I could get to where I would understand much of what is being said around me and be able to carry on little conversations, I would be happy."
"That is silly of me, especially considering the fact that I just mentioned how much sadness I have about all of this. I think one thing that I am really sad about is that I've stayed in such a situation for so long. I've put myself, and Myles, through hell. My self-esteem was so damaged and I had absolutely no self-love that I accepted things that were not acceptable."

"Overall, if you’re a Gears fan or love third person cover based action, RAAMs Shadow is worth a download. It gives you some interesting back story to a different event in the Gears universe, adds cool moments like using the Hammer of Dawn command post, tense boss fights, and the ability to cause some destruction with General RAAM himself. It’ll also allow you Gears vets to relive the old days with destroying e-holes and the building hoping nature of the first game. Sure it does have a few quirks mentioned above like tedious enemy choke points, continuity/prequel issues, and no major story reveals, it’s still a ton of fun to play and that’s what’s important here. It’ll also run you about 3 hours which for DLC isn’t bad at all. Now that we got to play as RAAM, here’s to more alternate Gears events featuring General Skorge. Ah, we can dream can’t we?"
"Similarly we’ve built great depth in the middle distances.

Uceny lead the world over 1500 at 4:00.06, with Jenny Simpson (4:03.54), Christin Wurth Thomas (4:03.72), and Worlds semifinalist Shannon Rowbury (4:05.73) all among the world’s best."

If it is not too noisy, I think a train is the perfect place to read. So yesterday I made some progress through The Science of Dr Who by Paul Parsons. As I said last week, I am a long-term fan of Dr Who, and this book makes me want to watch all the episodes again from scratch because I think I'd look at them with new insight. At the end of each one I could turn to whoever was watching them with me and say something like 'they could do that, you know...'"

Then he was run down by a hit-and-run driver and left for dead. I did that to put an irreparable crack in the characters' lives, and in the story. I wanted Jesse and Evan to live with the effects of violent crime, in a way that would never disappear. They can't ignore it or forget about it. It's always there. So the story is about how they deal with the physical and emotional consequences. It's about how Jesse rebuilds his life, and they build their relationship, in the aftermath."

"Communication is essential to achieving a dependable distributed embedded system. Designers of these systems are faced with several challenges in specifying the communication network. Complex systems usually require some sort of shared media network. In this environment, the designer must recognize the fundamental trade-off that exists between the efficiency and the predictability of the network. Given this trade-off, the designer must evaluate and select the communication network. Particular attention must be given to the protocols, which determine much of the network behavior. Finally, many error detection methods are available which are necessary to build a reliable communication system."

"This now leads to me and where I am at now. As we have come to our resting place in Clarksboro, NJ. I now reside in the armpit of America and as I write this, I have peace that, for now, the Lord wishes to reveal Himself to me during these two months in a way that will be remarkable. Now equipped with these truths on my belt, I will be awarded with more. And prayerfully, as I continue in obedience and trusting Him, who has called me according to His purpose, that He may be glorified, I will be granted more weapons on my belt, to be ready for every good work. God has done an amazing thing in my life and continually reveals Himself to me in challenging ways, but lovingly provides a path for me to go down. Because of my past, I know where the world leads. Destruction. In my room in El Salvador, I had a picture on my wall, as a constant reminder that was left there. It was a beautiful picture depicting the two paths. One, that leads to destruction. In it, were things of the world. Bars, immorality, the luxuries of this world and at the end of the path, was a flaming pit of darkness and death. And the people on that path were wondering, lost and alone. In darkness. On the contrasting side, was the path that led to heaven. It was narrow, and few followed it. It was difficult. But as they slowly ascended the path, they found their reward, as they entered the gates of heaven, entering into eternal life with God, rather than death and destruction with Satan."

So, I spent several sessions a day lying on the floor with my pelvis raised on cushions. After a week or so without progress I consulted Ilana Machover, whose National Childbirth Trust antenatal classes I had attended during my first pregnancy. She immediately suggested that crawling might help and arranged an appointment to show me how to do it. Learning to do the exercise properly proved more difficult than I expected, but once I was crawling to Ilana’s satisfaction I found it a curiously relaxing activity and crawled around the living room several times a day."

Ever since Marx published his Communist Manifesto in 1848 -- well before that, in fact -- the left has sought totalitarian control over the means of production, and indeed over all aspects of human life. Modern-day practitioners such as Barack Obama know that the best way to bring about increased regulation, and thus control, is through the fiction of a crisis that can be addressed only by government."

"UPDATE: Herman Cain has suspended his campaign after a woman named Ginger White stepped forward and claimed a thirteen year affair with the candidate. It seems that this particular bit of smoke had some fire behind it. Cain blames the media for his sinking polls and thus the suspension of his campaign, but it would be more likely that his poor performance in interviews and debates - particularly on foreign affairs - did him in. If allegations of affairs with presidential candidates were disqualifiers, Bill Clinton would never have been elected. But the Lothario-in-Chief got into the Oval Office because his responses and debate performances were as strong and rock-solid as his libido. In my opinion, Herman Cain's campaign was over with that infamous question on Libya. It's painful to watch. I'm with S.E.

His name recognition is up a bit from May, but those who have an opinion on him now who didn't before are split evenly in approval and disapproval. 39% approve, 35% disapprove, and still 26% aren't sure how they feel about his performance so far. Three months ago, it was 35-31-34."

"And then my favorite part (do you sense the sarcasm)... the Dolly Parton hills. Doesn't everyone like a couple of long steep hills at mile 20 of a marathon? The hip was having no part in the hills... and finally, I had to take a couple of very short walk breaks on the steepest parts. I was being very good, though, about keeping the breaks extremely short. I would guess I walked less than 1/2 mile over the entire duration of the marathon."
"Scott Nichols: This sort of thing happens all of the time in games, but usually only with mechanics. Fighting games and online shooters are constantly tweaked due to fan feedback, and last year Uncharted 3′s aiming mechanics were changed after overwhelming fan outcry. But this is the first time I can think of that this has happened with a game’s plot or narrative."
"I was surprised to find this picture as the sixth in my folder, and the moment I saw it, the precise memories of what I was doing at the time jumped straight to the forefront of my mind. I could tell you about how my poor connection lagged terribly that day in Stormwind with all the post-patch crowding on the realm and how I got turned around in the north alley of the Trade District trying to find the barber shop (I very, very rarely use it). I could tell you how we searched for the perfect spot to dance and take screenshots. I could even tell you that this shot is not my favorite from that day; that honor belongs to one Catulla took and features some random toon flying by in the background, an oddly floating Worg Pup in tow, because the “flying non-combat pet” bug had yet to be fixed for pets that weren’t supposed to fly. Random gliding doggie is still an in-joke that makes me grin, though I acknowledge its lack of meaning to anyone but myself."

"Baby Bee and I have had a wonderful time nursing so far. Right off the bat he was an excellent nurser, which was awesome. With my firstborn there was a bit more of a learning curve, and a bit more soreness. One thing that has been the same with both boys, however, is my intense hunger when I'm breastfeeding! If I go too long without food, it is not pretty. In the first weeks of breastfeeding, I am hungrier than when I am pregnant. So it's important to have a lot of healthy, easy to grab snacks around so I don't eat a bunch of junk or starve to death."

"Traditionally men are supposed to be the protectors, which is a role I hold dear and refuse to not play. A lot of men play the role too but they go very overboard. They end up controlling the woman in their life, and it turns to abuse and disrespect.

"NOTE: And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."

To start with he seems to take Joseph and then Rose on as science projects, but then he largely abandons Joseph to go off to University and seems almost to be toying with Rose’s affections, responding to her whenever she calls but never reacting to her clear adoration of him."

The insurance company may require you to use one of its own contracted attorneys, or even one of its in-house attorneys which it employs directly. Given the limited number of attorneys with experience at handling nursing law issues and trying malpractice cases, the nurse should attempt to obtain coverage through a company which allows her to choose her own attorney."

"When it comes to changing diapers, there hasn’t been much advancement in the past century. Sure, we’ve gone from cloth to disposable diapers, an innovation that had moms the world over crying for joy, but beyond that, many parents have followed the same diaper-changing protocol for generations: remove soiled diaper, clean, apply lotion and sprinkle your little one – and everything around them – with baby powder. If only the process could be made easier and less messy. Coming this spring, Baby Magic® – a mom- and physician-approved brand for more than 100 years – will revolutionize the industry with the launch of Patty Cake®, the world’s first U.S. patented*, talc-free, dustless baby powder compact that will help give parents the magic touch at the changing table."

"I decided to break out of my comfort zone and use tape to create a sharp outer wing. I never wing out my eyeshadow because I can't usually figure out the right angle for my eye shape. Some people can do their crease colour and then use makeup remover and a cotton bud to create a wing, but that doesn't work for the rounded colour placement I usually do. The tape was uncomfortable as hell but I guess I finally figured it out! I also ventured out of my comfort zone by using eyeshadows wet, which I usually try to avoid at all costs because I'm lazy as fuck XD"
"What a busy week it has been! On Monday and Tuesday I took our daughter to All County Chorus practice from 8:15 - 1:15 (I dropped her off). Her music teacher from school was there to supervise (there were 3 from her school and about 200 5th grade students in all). Tuesday night she had her performance. I also had a board meeting from 4:15 - 5:30pm on Tuesday so it was the mad dash to get everyone where they needed to be. My husband also had an elder board meeting that night so he came to the performance and then went straight to the meeting (he was late with everyone's blessing - family first!). Our eldest son had an IB Extended Essay Abstract reading that same night, so he went there and our middle son skipped his Boy Scout meeting to go support his big brother."

"The LDS Church also supplied smaller Utah membership numbers to the state — figures government officials use for planning. Its report pegged U.S. Mormon growth at 45.5 percent, jumping from 4,224,026 in 2000 to 6,144,582 in 2010. The 2000 figure, though, was much lower than the 5,208,827 listed in the LDS Church's almanac. If researchers had been given that figure, the percentage of growth would have been considerably smaller, closer to 18 percent."

"I was returning the borrowed minis moments later, the battle lasted fewer than 15 minutes, and we never got through the whole count. I am sure glad the skeletons rolled a 22 initiative, or they never would have gone at all. The best part of it was that everyone really got into this 15 minute battle. I believe the poor deva was the only one who didnt get a chance to whale on some skeleton, while 3 pc’s won the “3 minions in an encounter” award. After the battle, they got to loot some dead adventurers outside the hidden chamber (the unfortunate party who discovered the chamber) and received 2 healing potions and a cloak of resistance. I will bring them cards next week, I wish I had time this week. The party discussed the items and made very reasonable choices about how to divide the loot. I was surprised at how naturally it occured: the cleric got the cloak of resistance, while the two main tanks, the swordmage and the battlemind, got the healing potions. Incidentally those two pc’s are the only ones to drop to zero hp in an encounter so far."

Perhaps it was his inexperience with trisomy 18, fear of the unknown? I’m not sure what the problem was, but I am sure that no parent, ourselves included, appreciate being offered condolences on their living, breathing child that is very much alive! I won’t bother you with the specifics, other than to say the short visit was very upsetting."
"So, we went round the whole discussion again: Audi should replace this, the car is clearly not safe to drive so isn't ready to pick-up! This time I was told that it was a long time ago that the replacement dashboards were done for free (in fact I'd found that a memo was sent in April 2009 telling agents that the criteria had been toughened-up, see one of the links below), I pointed out that, when I first took my car to the Audi garage they replaced the coil packs at no cost because of an existing fault in this component (okay, cheaper item but probably harder to do the work for them, dash is easy apparently). They suggested that later repairs had been done with Audi making a contribution to this cost, I said that would be a much better option providing it was a pretty big contribution as £900 (or even £800) is ridiculous. They said they'd talk to someone higher up."

"Then secondly a flat plate shape is formed into the vane, this is the equivalent of the Linear dampers damping rod. This arm needs to be a close fit to the damper cavity in order to accurately control oil for the damping effect. It’s the edges of this arm that need to be sealed against the housing. A single square edged seal is fitted into a machined groove around the periphery of the vane. There are also four friction reducing pads (two on each side) to aid the movement of the vane against the body."

"Take the scene where the Avengers are assembling for the first time around the big table. She spends the scene standing in the liminal space between the Avengers and bridge operations. It’s Hill who answers Stark’s questions about the Helicarrier, and then when Fury arrives she keeps her place but her presences slides into the background. The camera finds her a couple times, like when she’s standing behind Thor as he discusses Loki with the rest of the group. It’s a great shot; you could say that Hill is just standing there to add some depth to the scene, to remind the audience where this meeting is taking place, but the way Hill is postured, with her head half-turned away, gives the impression of that liminal space. She’s the only person in the Helicarrier, in that moment, whose focus is split between the Avengers and the Helicarrier, and Smulders does a bang-up job at looking interested without giving off a mother hen vibe."
"Whereas the original Cars tried to re-create a 50s Route 66 American Southwest vibe, this is a full-on 1960s British spy caper feel. Everything from the supercool Finn McMissile to the gadgets to the music makes those of us old enough to remember them (or those willing to have checked them out on Netflix or cable TV) the spy movies of Caine, James Bond or James Coburn, among others. There are homages to these films scattered throughout, sometimes subtly and occasionally not so much."

"Billy Bob Thornton is his usual self in this flick as Ed Crane (great name), which is what adds a lot to this character and film as well. Billy Bob isn’t exciting, he barely shows any emotions, he smokes in about every single frame of this flick, and he’s a character that just seems like he doesn’t care at all about anything but it’s also what makes this character work. It may have been hard to feel anything for him but I was still able to like Billy Bob playing Crane because even though we may always seem him play the same character in every flick no matter what, it still never really gets old and still seems fresh especially when he’s playing a barber."

"Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat. Grill the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side (depending on how thick the chicken breasts are), until the chicken is no longer pink in the center (if you have a meat thermometer, the chicken should register 165 degrees). Tent with foil and let the chicken rest for about five minutes before serving. This recipe would also work well to make tasty chicken kebabs. Simply marinate chunks of chicken according to the directions above."

"The Phantom of Pemberley is my favorite because it was my first attempt at writing a cozy mystery. I have read cozies for years, and I loved the idea of trying to incorporate all the characteristics of the genre into my Pride and Prejudice mystery. Normally, a cozy is set in a village, where all those involved are familiar with each other. There is no graphic violence, no explicit sex scenes, and no profanity. Cozies are considered “genteel” mysteries. Think of “Murder She Wrote” on TV or Agatha Christie, and one has the cozy format. A cozy would never make a good “action” movie: the emphasis is on plot twists and character development. In The Phantom of Pemberley, I used the idea of “The Shadow Man,” which is what Wes Craven reportedly used for his Freddy Krueger. In England, the “shadow man” is a popular legend. Plus, Adam Lawrence becomes an active member of the story line. Lawrence has had “walk throughs” in several of my novels. In “Phantom,” he became an integral part of the cast, and I am so pleased with the outcome. (I have written a novella that tells Lawrence’s story. I hope to publish it soon.) I was rewarded for my attempts by having “Phantom” marked with a third place finish in Romantic Suspense in a RWA (Romance Writers of America) contest in 2010."

So not only did I win beads, which is really fab in itself, but also beads in a colour scheme I like and, above all: it's czech beads! (And info about czech beads, which is also great for a bead nerd/""bead colour collector"" like me even if it might sound strange to be so pleased about getting promotional material.)"
"Fashion is not something that should cause stress. Again, it’s hard to separate fashion from our social necessities, but our awareness of what we’re doing when thinking about our appearance should be more apparent. The beauty and artistry of fashion come from the new and exciting ways that we are able to display ourselves without needing to say a word. Fashion is perfect where it is also imperfect. The exact quality that is able to free us is also able to cage us. Customization and originality are often marginalized based on what society says we should look like. I’m not meaning to be all-knowing or to repeat something we’ve all heard since the first grade, but it’s important to remember that what we wear on the exterior should mirror the interior above all else (black shoes still should not be worn with brown belts, as I’ve learned, but no matter)."
"This is the same method I used originally: with acrylic paints I painted some random, colourful squares in different colours and then, once they had dried a touch, so as not to smear the paint around, I painted over them in white. The result is an abstract with colour peaking through white. In some cases the ""white"" is actually a super pale hue."

Driving home late at night. The windows open. The roof open. The cool, humid night in Ft. Lauderdale. It was the summer of '88 and I was back at home. Working two jobs. Working harder than I'd ever worked before. But loving it just the same. All my friends were home that summer. Indeed, 1988 was the last summer we all came home. Sometime the previous Fall, I'd signed up with Columbia House and ordered 12 tapes for cheap. And because I liked Magic Power, I included Triumph in my order."

That he can crawl so quickly away from me that he is in another room and up to no good before I can turn around. That he has gained such independence that he refuses to allow me to feed him at all, even when we are in a hurry, and he wants his own spoon or fork. That he has such a voice that he will let us know he is happy or mad loudly, and increasingly with words - a loud ""NO!"" or a thrilled, ""YAY!"" or a demanding ""BALL!"" - even if we are in a restaurant and the other patrons are turning around. That there are many, many moments each day that I look at Charlie and don't think of Spina Bifida at all, because it fades behind his beautiful smile, sheer determination and his strength."

I like how Oreki leads a low-energy lifestyle, sounds kind of like me except for he really takes it to the extreme.

I wanted to be able to travel and get to know Europe while I studied abroad, and I knew if I was too focused on school I wouldn’t be able to do that. In order to learn French better, CIEE requires that we live with a host family and have a “language buddy”, a local Parisian who wants to learn English. Though I know nothing about my host family or where I will be living, I can’t wait to move in! I meet them on Friday night after living in a hotel for a three-day orientation. Then we will have a week of French-intensive instruction, as well as a group day trip to Metz, France. Classes don’t start until January 23!"

"I already knew from wise people's experience not to buy a full bottle unsniffed; even more, not to buy a full bottle without having tested the fragrance for at least a day, if not more.

I started with the classics, the problem being the ones I wanted to smell the most were nowhere to be found. I moved on to mainstream gems, but nothing caught my heart. And then, out of all places, I found it in a niche perfumery in Warsaw - it beckoned me with a scent somewhere from my childhood (of course!), somewhere from my dreams. I had it on my mind for days before venturing out to Nordstrom to grab a sample; and then it was just a couple of days more until I was ordering a full bottle all for myself."

"There are some out there who only have faded, distant memories of such times and for them, I can understand. The happiness of Christmas is only a twinkling memory in many minds and we can only think about the here and now, the times when everything is too much to bear sometimes and makes us only want to cower in a corner and shut out the rest of the world. I hear you. All that I can say to you is: think back to when you can remember opening that first Christmas present on a chilly December 25th morning while the folks looked on happily, knowing that for all the work, bills and toil that awaited them after today, at least NOW was good."

"Akin to their heavily muscled, racially ambiguous brethren, the Paul brothers bring an off-kilter approach to their line readings that causes the person who is watching and listening to tilt their head slightly to the side while simultaneously making a nonplussed expression with their face. Loudly screaming their dialogue with heightened sense of urgency, the Peter and David bring an unconventional charm to their roles. Whether uttering nonsensical gibberish, babbling incoherently or merely mixing their metaphors, the thickly structured duplicates do so with an exaggerated brand of comical desperation."

It happens sometimes and when it does, that key ingredient that makes writing fun begins to die. But just like everything else in life, the writing process is a lesson. Coming out of that fire unburned yet reeking of smoke, I began to evaluate what I’ve learned."

I’ve enjoyed Bane as a comics character in recent years, particularly as a demented father figure among younger villains in Gail Simone’s unfairly canceled Secret Six. There, he was well-spoken and had a twisted sense of honor that spurred him into the most unpredictable decisions in any given situation.

"#731 - Great Expectations (1946) - (#335 on TSPDT) David Lean's films tend to be long and drawn out and often quite tedious. Granted, they usually look great, but still, for better and for worse, they have no real feel to them. With that said, I must admit to actually enjoying this rather truncated version of the Dickens classic. Even with its silly, happy ending. Does this make me a bad person? Oh well."

That was all back in June. Now here we are in January of 2012, and I have only 346 days left to finish this journey (to understand where I get this number, please check out this link). Although, more realistically speaking, I’ve got about 142 days before this journey takes a huge step downward on my priority meter (to understand this number, please check out this link).

"After the war, a sense of shame at our past and achievements became widespread amongst the intelligentsia, and led to an ineluctable weakening of our national identity. Our elites began wittingly and unwittingly to dismantle the very idea of England. Social engineering started to be used in architecture and planning as much as in education and entertainment. Its aim was to change the physical and mental environment, and thereby change people, who were seen as plastic and malleable. The theory was that planned council estates could change people for the better."

King paints the portrait of a dark town full of secrets and tragedy, and it haunted me well after the section was over. Still, creepy* as it was, it was also my favorite part because it felt so real.

"I would have loved to have been born the beautiful and outrageously stylish Daphne Guiness, personal friend of the late Alexander McQueen and Isabella Blow. By a quirk of birth, she happens to be an heiress with, I assume, nothing to spend her money on or do with her time but what she truly loves. And she loves fashion, buying and wearing. She's the same age as me, but different build, but if we lived in the same street, I'm sure we'd be best friends. One of the things I love is to sit on the beds of my best girl friends while they show me their favourite clothes, or latest buys. I did this on Saturday at my friend, Taryn's after we went to her friend's sculpture exhibition opening, (where I met a man in a very cool jacket, who told me it was made in Wellington in the 60s, which opened a conversation about style. He unbuttoned his jacket and showed me the amazing lining. I then admired his floral shirt. Well, I guess you had to be there.) Then after admiring Taryn's coat collection, she came over to my place and I showed her some of my favourite shoes. My other friend Monique is fabulous for shoes, she has some beauties. I just love looking at people's stuff."

"The limitations with this project were that I was attempting to work with floral blinds that are not at all to my taste, and a fairly innocuous mushroom carpet. The expense of replacing the blinds I just couldn't justify, so I had to find a creative way to work them into my style. They were originally part of a Shabby Chic meets Laura Ashley style of decoration that the previous occupant favoured. But it was just too insipid for me. After hours of wallpaper stripping, and a month or so of living with colour chips on the wall to aid in the decision process, I tossed the whole lot out and went on instinct with this fabulous blue.

"How could such a thing happen? It’s probably difficult today to understand how remote Europe seemed in those days of the early Internet. In addition to the language barrier, communication took place primarily via paper mail. Phone calls were prohibitively expensive, so there was simply not that much contact between the average American author and foreign publishers. Add to that authors’ general inhibition about contacting publishers directly, and you had a situation that was ripe for exploitation."

The historical personage is assimilated to his mythical hero…, while the event is identified with the category of mythical action…”"
"So I wonder why we have a problem with the Turks and no problem with the Japanese, not even in Düsseldorf. Nobody inquires after their birth rate. No authorities are putting interpreters at their disposal. There has not been a summit on Japan — or Asia — with the ministry of the interior.

"It originates from the Christian God. That refutes your absurd claim of ""which god?"" also. As if you didn't know. Because, as you well know, it is the Christian position that God has revealed Himself to all mankind so that we can know for certain who He is. Those who deny His existence are suppressing the truth in unrighteousness to avoid accountability to God. It is the ultimate act of rebellion against Him and reveals the professing atheist's contempt toward God."

"This result suggests that Denisovans ranged into Southeast Asia and interbred with the ancestors of some of today’s populations at least 44,000 years ago, a date suggested by archaeological finds, Reich said. When researchers used their findings to estimate mixing between ancestors of the present-day populations at that time, they found no sign that ancestors of today’s mainland East Asian populations were present. So those ancestors must have shown up in a later migration, the researchers concluded."

She was having a couple of other people over as well—which made me nervous as I’m not always able to socialize well amongst strangers, but all went well. Her 2 friends were astrologers and 1 also made crystal jewelery. These 2 people being astrologers really seemed significant to me. I’m really interested in astrology and metaphysics and with the changes I’ve been making in my life it was almost as if I was receiving a sign from the Universe. I got a tingling-type feeling, almost like a simmering of excitement. It was weird but in a good way."

"The record came out in 1988, and seriously? Only 100 copies pressed? That seems like a waste but maybe records were cheaper to press back then? I saw this record for sale at the Underground and didn't buy a copy because I knew I had it recorded on tape at home. I won that round! Released by Chapter III Records in Arizona in 1988. At that time I was a junior at Eldorado High School. I lived across the street from the entrance to EHS at 1114 Linn Lane. My front lawn was the smoking section. That was a lifetime ago."
"With the book of nature, man remains external to the metaphor, as the intended reader. Human beings are among the things brought under the clock metaphor, however, in the works of Voltaire and Vauvenargues. The French moralists typically indentified the passions with the internal working of the clock, and reason as the display (in a way that hoped to gain assent and accomplish their aims) of those hidden instincts and passions.

"Chris graduated from the Citadel military college and entered the Army as a 2nd Lieutenant. He was promoted quickly up through the ranks over the years that followed.

Chris was seriously injured, but the medics on the scene saved his life and got him airlifted out of there.

Since she takes after me when she gets hungry, my sweet child turns into Sybil on speed."

"I submit that, for the most part, we can all agree that Sagan’s many contributions to science advocacy were varied and effective. Among many other accomplishments, he was a long-time advisor to NASA, wrote many popular books and the novel Contact, co-authored many scientific papers, and perhaps most notably, co-authored and narrated the science program Cosmos. I am primarily using the widespread admiration of Sagan’s work as a bit of common ground between Gnus and accommodationists. But I want to avoid recruiting Carl Sagan the man as a Gnu for two reasons: 1) sadly, he’s not around to represent his own views; 2) his arguments and methods now have a life of their own and stand or fall on their own merits."
"When you lose someone significant in your life, someone whose very being has helped define you in some way, grief can be overwhelming. So many stages and shades of grief bombard you that at times you think you are going crazy — but except for the very extremes of grief — mummifying yourself so you don’t feel anything for years on end or saving pills so you can end your life — chances are what you are feeling is normal."

A few days ago we all went to the swimming pool, which is something Paul's missed a lot because I don’t know a man who’s willing to come with us. I can’t take him alone, because obviously he’s not allowed in the ladies changing room and I’m not allowed in the men’s and Paul can’t really manage on his own (neither can he be entirely trusted not to touch things he shouldn't when he isn't being supervised). Needless to say, he loved every second of it! He played with his baby niece in the tiny tots pool, swam with his sister in the bigger children’s pool, had lots of fun on the big slides and thought the wave pool was hilarious."

It's desperately trying to seek one, and I'm just watching and listening. Not judging, not giving in to its ludicrous demands, just seeing. Just hearing. Go ahead and rant and rave, I can't stop you anyway.

In reality, of course, there will be weeds, crops will do poorly, there will be too little or too much rain, there will be weeds. In short nothing will be perfect. Except, it will be in many ways. There will always be that one crop that did amazing. There will be thing that keeps us all going."

"The key to this is never forcing it. It cannot be hurried or forced. These energies are unstoppable. Of course, they work with your free choice. We do not remove free choice, but you are filled with such energy as you are going to start to note that your choices are shifting, and they are shifting to a higher vibration. This sense of exhaustion — and it may fluctuate — is going to also be filled with times of exuberance and unlimited energy, as if you could circle the globe three times flying with me and still want to go on further."

"I have also finished the second of the Silver Trilogy books. I feel drained. It is a mesmerizing, but totally uncomfortable series. I repeat, read at your own risk. I do not recommend it. I hope to have the third book finished this week so I can rest and recuperate. R & R. Like Gary had from Viet Nam. I wonder if they still do that for the soldiers? Like in the Middle East--a brief 5-day respite from the war. And where do they go? To China? Russia? Hmmmm....in our days it was Thailand, or, as in Gary's case, Hawaii. Yeah, I could use a trip to Hawaii right after I finish this series. Too bad I have to wait until April. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're thinking, wah, poor baby. Aren't you? LOL. Probably not."

And over the course of the series I grew to like it quite a bit - Celia is a smart character, which unfortunately sometimes seems a bit rare. How often do you find yourself thinking to a character ""No! Don't do that you idiot! Don't go there without telling someone! Don't go in the dark basement with no flashlight!"" etc. I didn't experience that with her - things just get totally messed up despite her doing her best to prevent it."

Apparently they have to sex up a particular Vulcan woman they’re betrothed to because that lovesick groupie Nurse Chapel is hanging around, bringing him homemade Vulcan soup, and Spock doesn’t want any of what she’s offering. (They have to mate on Vulcan, too, apparently, because that works better for the plot.)"

"On March 1 – March 8, 2012, I went to the Mayan Riviera on the first BCBD Transformation Retreat. This marked the 5th anniversary of BCBD. The months and days leading up to this were pretty intense. There was my lower back sprain about six weeks before the trip which I iced and stretched as often as I could. Then three weeks before the trip, my ankle sprain. I was so scared I wouldn’t be able to go. Luckily, it was no biggie compared to the back. Same drill as the back, just ice and stretch. During this whole time, I was also studying for an exam. It was one week before the trip and once it was done, my free time was dedicated to getting last minute things for the trip."
"The space is quite comfortable--and had already attracted a pretty good crowd when we visited a little over a week ago. The front of the pub curls around a groovy bar, and there are open spaces in the back festooned with large, flat-screen TVs (tuned to a Bears game when I was there). They both suit the sports fan but remain comfortably out of the way for non-fans. At the end of the review, I'll copy in a minute of footage I shot at the pub so you can get a sense of the space."

"Further I asked, “Daddy would love to understand why you no longer want to partake in dead animal flesh, from poorly mistreated animals, that were probably beaten and abused before they got on our plate.” She replied that, “She doesn’t like the taste of meat.” This response sent Daddy into a tizzy. I immediately started yelling which is Daddy’s first and only line of defense. As I screamed at my daughter that she could have approached her new found vegetarianism in so many different ways and that I feel like she has decided to become a vegetarian as a way of rebelling against Daddy and I feel like she is holding a shotgun to my head.

For $25 (still a luxury item price range), people with no skill in processing could get a camera pre-loaded with 100 exposures of Kodak film, take the photos (literally, it was point and shoot—not even a viewfinder to look through), and then ship the whole camera back to Rochester, New York for processing. In about a week, you'd get your prints and your camera back with a new roll of film—all for $10 (still, not cheap). Eastman completely took away the technical burden of processing."

"One final request please. We are struggling for illustrators; Steven Franklin is doing very well, but we don’t want to overwork him! Our other illustrator, Wayne, is off line at the moment due to his PC being rebuilt. So, if anyone would like to send us an example of their work we would be happy to consider it. If we like it we would be delighted to include it in the book alongside the originals, but we cannot, unfortunately, pay people. However, we hope that the opportunity of getting some work into the books, with - of course - our recommendations will suffice."

"MM has been a trooper through all this, too. He takes me to every appointment, actively participates, hold my hand and stays calm through every bump in the road. Even though he knew us having a baby wouldn't be a breeze, he still, I don't think, knew all that it would entail. Of course I didn't necessarily, either, as every pregnancy is different . . .theoretically. Unfortunately I'm proving to be pretty predictable at developing pregnancy induced hypertension. Well, we'll enjoy because this is most likely the last two weeks of me being pregnant in my life. Sigh."

"Why is this all top of mind? I have a close family member with Parkinson’s disease. It’s a constant struggle to get him to focus on all of the positive things in his life. Every phone call turns into complaints about how he doesn’t feel well. I have sympathy. But he’s in his 70′s and has had a wonderful life. He still has the ability to walk and he doesn’t shake too badly. He was diagnosed in his mid 60′s. I keep thinking what Michael J. Fox wouldn’t have done for 30 extra year’s of normalcy. And somehow Michael J. Fox gets his chin up and accomplishes things. So did Christopher Reeves. And Bethany Hamilton (the teenage surfer who lost her arm in a shark attack) - how many people would have her positive attitude and keep surfing? How many would lead a life of “poor me?”"

I have been known to add an entire tin of anchovy fillets because I love them so much. I couldn't imagine caesar salad without them, but if you don't care for them, then leave them out and use a bit of salt in their place."
"Leave it to steep for a while. Heck, go do something else, like clean off your workbench or eat some Doritos. If you're going for a specific color, check the progress every few minutes, especially if you tossed the steel wool in there.

"H - Let’s pick up on something we spent a long time discussing when we started this blog: our decision to post our first-draft comics pages here. This is primarily a “making of” blog, examining the process of creating a graphic novel (aimed at readers interested in “creative process” issues as well as comics fans) – rather than the kind of comics blog where a final story is presented in weekly installments. Because of this, we spent a good while debating what we should post here by way of comic pages, since normally one doesn't publish first-draft work! However, we realised early on that in order to discuss the ‘making of’ our novel, we'd need to introduce some of the characters and plot lines -- otherwise the blog would be full of story references that readers wouldn’t understand. It would become nonsensical!"
"After Love’s masterpiece Forever Changes was released in November1967 the band started to go though numerous personal changes. Drugs, specifically heroin and LSD, have been reported as a contributing major factor in the band becoming dysfunctional. Lee, guitarists John Echols, Ken Forssi and the other main songwriter in the band Bryan MacLean were all using drugs on a regular basis. Lee had an unusual arrangement with their record label Elektra where all royalties went to him, which also created a lot of tension within the band. Stuart-Ware writes about the ongoing financial issues, where they were promised money that never appeared. MacLean left in 1968 and Love was never really the same."
"If it was not for Bradman, Hammond would perhaps be the greatest pre-war batsman in the game, and certainly the greatest of his generation. It was by sheer coincidence that the careers of Hammond and Bradman ran almost parallel to each other in splendid fashion. He established himself firmly as not just Hobbs’ successor as the greatest English batsman but also the finest batsman in the world when, only in his second series (the 1928 Ashes), he shattered the record books by accumulating 905 runs in 5 Tests at 113. He kick-started a great rivalry with the Don when he broke his world record of the highest individual Test score by scoring an unbeaten 336 against New Zealand in 1933. Despite losing six of his best years to war, Hammond scored over 50,000 first class runs and at the time of his retirement, held the world record for most Test runs."

Closing out the journey is Toy Box Trio with their usual ephemeral toy piano tones to bring this strange voyage to a close."

I have projects lined up and much work and writing ahead of me, not to mention the workshops and events here at the farm. I am not asking for any help from the readers, and won't. This is my choice and my life and I can't spend any more time of it behind a desk working for somebody else. I have to make this step or I'll never be able to respect myself. I am thrilled and somber about it. Making this decision is a step I have been hesitating over out of nothing but fear. Fear isn't welcome here anymore. Ever."

"Clark later admitted the song was about drugs as well as the flight to London. A radio trade journal article decrying the song's drug connotations caused many American radio stations to take it off their playlist, which is probably why it reached only #14 on the Billboard ""Hot 100."" (It's astonishing to me that a song that was so radically experimental made it to #14. AM radio music in the 1960s was really, really good.)"

"Her foster sister Onyx perhaps has the opposite problem: She’s a very bold, extremely intense Belgian malinois/shepherd cross and she is just stunning; she is sable with orange-rust-colored eyes and looks like a wolf. Onyx sounds amazing, but probably way too much to handle for us, being first-timers. Her foster mom says she is twice as intelligent and twice as energetic and driven as any shepherd she’s ever fostered! Schutzhund–and daily 5-mile runs–would probably be best for Onyx. She doesn’t sound like a fit for us, but I am excited to meet her just the same."
"Anyhow, that's all done. I told my husband about this blog and he gave me the crazy eyes. I have been reading blogs for about a month now and it is starting to border on obsession. These women are so crafty, so creative and on top of it they are super nice about sharing their ideas. I will tell you my favorites in another post. (Beth from above is definately a fave of mine :) But, hubbie just smiles when I show him all the ideas I want to implement in our house. God love him. He puts up with this :) But after I explained how this could keep him connected to us when he is gone and give our families an oppurtunity to see what it is like down here he agreed it was a good idea. Can you believe it? He thought me blogging was a good idea... funny hubbie :)"

"Of course now its deemed legal, teams can either formally protest it or adopt it themselves. Doing the the latter is possible for most teams, as they have apertures in the footwell area to fit a snorkel, while the shark fin and rear wing are easily created. But, finding a route for the duct out of the tub might prove the headache, as the monocoque may not have any openings sufficiently large enough. This year the monocoque is also is subject to homologation and hence cannot be altered until the 2011 season. Of course ‘where there’s a will, there’s a way’, teams will not want to lose a straight line speed advantage."

I am waiting for additional yarn to arrive for the ""I Heart Aran"" sweater that I'm working on - from the beautiful Tanis Fiber Arts wool that I purchased at Knitters' Frolic - of course, I ran out of wool and had to order some more just as I was finishing up the collar! While I'm waiting for my extra wool to come in the mail, I started a new project - the Ambleside Shawl. This is my first shawl and I found it while searching around Ravelry for a pattern for some new wool that I bought. I picked up a few skeins of Noro Cashmere Island in Colorway ""B"" - beautiful shades of blue, purple and green."

"Coca-Cola claimed that it was the first company to register the trade mark at the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI) back in 2004. It further argued that the mark is not merely descriptive, since it has no meaning. Among the arguments, it claimed Ordinance 27/1998 of the Ministry of Health which handles sign that are not registrable as trade mark – in this case it does not allow the use of the word zero in conjunction with other words, such as sugar. This is so, because the intention of the words is to inform consumers about the composition of the products. Furthermore, the company claimed that the use of the mark ‘zero’ by AMBEV is taking advantage and used unfairly (i.e. unfair competition law) and noted that the use will confuse consumers. However this latter argument was dismissed by the rapporteur of the case, Francisco Loureiro, explaining that the word zero does not produce confusion among the consumers since the package of Coca-Cola and AMBEV are quite different – adding that both products are well consolidated and differentiated in the market. In other words, it is saying that the most distinctive a mark is, the less it would lead to cause confusion."

"In a large bowl, whisk the flour and herb/spice mixture together. Gently rinse each blossom, pat dry, then cut off stems. Remove and discard the interior reproductive structures (either threads or stumps) that were attached to the stem. Discard. Fill a small bowl with club soda. Drop each blossom in, one at a time, carefully agitating the blossom to encourage it to open with the help of the club soda. Remove and shake excess club soda off. Drop blossom in flour mixture, tossing to coat, then hold blossom by stem end to lightly swish the flower end into the mixture as if a broom. Shake off excess flour mixture. The blossom should not be fully covered. Place prepared blossoms on a paper towel."

"Notes: Though I used boneless chicken, I think it will taste great with boned chicken too. Make sure to cut chicken in small size pieces. Since soya sauce is added, be careful while adding salt. While frying the chicken pieces, make sure that it is not over fried. The chicken is ready when it becomes golden brown. You can add chicken cube to enhance the flavour. If using chicken cube, add it along with the sauces while making the gravy. Again, the chicken cube is salty, so be careful while adding salt."
"This thought was brought to mind thanks to a blog post I read today, about how unfair it is that so many people are unable to adopt, and therefore lots of orphans are still living in poverty, some maybe being sent to an institution if not adopted. Are THEY going to get what they want? Do they expect it? No. Some will not even understand what Christmas is, and in this country (and other developed ones) kids are just spoiled. They expect to get what they want, without question."
"Well, that's where it gets kind of confusing: when you put the word ""zombie"" in your movie, then that should suggest there is some kind of horror or terror or scary stuff going on in the film itself, thus making it part of a sort of collective that suggests brain-eating shenanigans of some sort or other. Right? I'm not missing something on that line of thought, am I?"

"#33: Start & maintain a blog on a regular basis."
"Each month, July 2010-June 2011, is laid out with articles, charts, tips, activity ideas, links, and resource lists all related to a common theme. These themes range from Bible study tips, creative writing, and reading the classics to 'super' foods, computer literacy, and critical thinking. Interspersed are also articles on avoiding homeschool burn-out, making your own gluten- and dairy-free foods as well as non-toxic cleaners, and nature walks! Writers of these articles include people like Heidi St. John, Amy Pack, Molly Green, Jeannie Fulbright, Amanda Bennett, Karen Andreola, and my all-time favorite, Jane Lambert! It's really not fair to think of this as a planner because it is SO much more! Not only can you plan anything and everything regarding your homeschooling but you can also sit and enjoy reading some really great articles, be encouraged by fellow homeschoolers, cook up something new, learn some new things yourself, and because there is so much information included (science, history, geograhpy, Bible, math), you can use this 'planner' to teach your children many different topics!"

What if I am meant to have all the plans I make fall through, never being able to have enough time or money to do the things that make me happy, not being able to be in a place that I like, working somewhere where the higher-ups talk to me like I’m some uneducated imbecile, having all of the people I enjoy move away and leave me sad and lonely?"

"David Freud’s history is interesting: he previously worked as a journalist for the Financial Times and then joined a leading UK investment bank (UBS investment banking), where he was on record as saying to his deputy: “If the rest of the country knew what we were being paid, there would be tumbrels on the streets and heads carried round on pikes”. In his city career he frequently got things seriously wrong. As one reviewer of his book put it, Freud “will be remembered in the City as one of the key players in several of the most embarrassing and badly managed deals in investment banking”. His revenue forecasts were, in his own words: “completely potty”; according to the Daily Telegraph, his financial plans for Euro Disney “went so goofy they almost wrecked his career” and on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link he got his sums wrong by £1.2 billion and had to be bailed out by the Government (www.variant.org.uk/events/Doc7Poverty/BankerBankies.pdf )."

"April 30th, 2012 would’ve been a boy named Deacon’s fourth birthday. I won’t profane Deacon’s memory or the depth of suffering his family has been through by trying to pretend that I can possibly understand, legitimately explain, or fully empathize with the horror of losing a child. I won’t blaspheme the sovereign love that God has for all of us by saying that it’s for “the best” or part of “his plan” to take the life of an almost-three-year-old — especially one who brought joy to so many. What I will say is that we, as a people, have been dealing with loss incorrectly for a long time, maybe forever. For years, loss — the loss of a job, or of a relationship, or of a dream, or of a loved one — has stirred up a reaction among people to try and marginalize the loss, or parade around an endless series of trite sayings and clichéd advice with the hopes of logic-ing away the hurt that the loss caused. This could not be further from helpful. Even of the truisms that are actually applicable to a situation, the last thing that anyone needs to hear in the midst of a new loss is how effective time will be for healing their wounds, or how many good things are going to be brought about from their circumstances. What people actually need in a time of loss, is just for you to be there with them, to suffer with them, to let them use and release misery for what it is — rather than try to coax them into behaving as if everything was all right."

"Here's a good way to start. Having said that, ""This ain't gonna happen"" My humble opinion of course. Pay cuts for the rich! Err, Congress. Compliments of ""The Hill"". Clik Here. It seems several taxpayer groups think pay cuts are in order for Congress. Who's going to argue with that. $174,000 is a little more than I make working for The Home Depot. Probably more than most Americans. Here again in my ever so humble opinion it would have to be a substantial cut. A small $5000 token cut ain't gonna get it for me. I once heard a story, don't know if it's true or not that George Washington had to put his farm up to have the money to go to Philadelphia to his own inauguration. I believe it was on Paul Harvey's ""The Rest of the Story"" One of you historians can check it out. Personally with all the benefits I think they should get about a grand a week."
"Close on 2 decades after Apartheid ended, failing high school pupils are told that the reason they can’t do Mathematics at school is because Apartheid made it difficult. These kids weren’t even born under the previous regime. Yet Apartheid South Africa produced some of the most brilliant minds in people of colour. Contrary to popular belief, they didn’t manage to study in exile. Most of them obtained world-class qualifications at South African universities. The same qualifications which obtained after 2000 are often laughed at in first world countries, because they are not worth the paper scribbled on. Such is the collapse of not only infrastructure, but also standards."
"At a third level, however, the story represented a failure of the Times’ public editor, a position established in the wake of the Jayson Blair scandal to represent the readers and to champion journalistic integrity from within the paper. Then-public editor Byron Calame penned two columns on the lacrosse case. The first, which appeared in spring 2006, minimized even the factual inaccuracies that had marred Roberts’ early columns. The second, which came after the exonerations in spring 2007, denied any ideological bias to the Times coverage, and declined even to speculate on why the Times had gotten the story so wrong for so long. It was left to the AJR and the Chronicle to analyze the Times’ wreckage."

"When the Kingdom is yet to be established, as is the case until the final point is formulated in Malkuth, strife is inevitable. This is the gradual development of the powers of Chesed and Geburah (Mercy and Severity) above the tree, they represent, “the strife of contending forces.” –spoken of in Liber Librae; thus the work of the magus in Tiphareth, and in all work upon the Middle Pillar, “to seek the light through their reconciliation.” Netzach represents in this struggle the experience of Victory, the reconciliation of opposition through force and passion. Hod represents the role of Strategy, cunning and wile, the overcoming of opposition through keen intellect, quick wit and applied logic. Together Netzach and Hod represent Harmony and Community and also represent the spoils of war, and the luxuries of peace: Love and Poetry, Art and Agriculture on the side of Netzach, Politics and Philosophy, Science and Industry on the side of Hod. These are the building blocks of civilization; once established they form the foundation that will inform and construct their Kingdom."

"He duly did and they weren’t cheap but the container of coir from India had come through from the port in Beira a lot quicker than I’d expected so I had no chance to shop around. I agreed and waited for the container to arrive which it did around 9 a.m. on Friday. By 10 a.m. there was still no sign of the forklift so I got back to Herbert who was as puzzled as I was. A bit of phoning around and we managed to contact the forklift driver but then lost the signal. I started to wonder if they were lost, it doesn’t take THAT long to get out from the industrial sites. By 11 I was distinctly annoyed and wondering if there was an alternative way to offload the container. I got another phone number off Herbert and managed to contact the driver’s assistant. They were some 2km down the road so would be here shortly. It was a noisy phone call with what sounded like a very noisy gearbox in the background. It really didn’t sound good. 10 minutes later they were still not in sight. I wondered about the gearbox sound and then the penny dropped; they were driving the forklift on the road – I’ve heard them and they make that sort of sound. I couldn’t believe it but shortly a small blue forklift appeared on the road to the nursery. They really had driven across town in a forklift!"

"There are always stories behind stories...big huge ones or tiny seeds. This is a big huge story so...please bear with me. Just last week I completed answering questions for an interview I did with soul sister Rita Banerji. I had been sitting with them for a while...I wrote tons and tons and then edited and edited. So...here's the thing. I realise that if I am going to claim my story...my entire story...then I have to talk about things I don't necessarily want to. sometimes. I have to be brave enough to share what I have been through and what I have learned from them . I edited this out of the interview thinking...""oh! it's not that important...no one would be interested in that"". But the truth is this right here: it's deeply deeply painful and there's a lot of shame + blame + guilt + other ""yucky"" emotions all tied into it that it was so much easier to edit it out. But it's big huge important. In large part because it is so difficult."

"The impact is further than the kids and the parents. It's the whole community. I'm fortunate enough to be able to pop into work for few hours and work virtually the rest of the day. However, another colleague isn't able to work virtually, so he needed to take a day off. This meant, his team needed to balance their load around his sudden time off. His clients may have needed him, but he wasn't available. Someone else paid for a babysitter for her twins while she went to work; the next day she swapped with someone else so she could stay home. Others are sending their kids to grandparents' and relatives' homes."

"AD/HD moment. Back to the Pig. I was going to mention, I don't think I made anything worse, injury-wise. I wondered for a moment after a big hill - I was HURTING - but after a couple of miles of relative flatness, my leg felt fine. It still feels ok. My glutes were pretty sore from the walking (again, newfound respect for walkers!) and my calf tightened up a bit, but it's not painful. I almost tried running yesterday but I think it still would've been hobbly. I have PT this morning and I'm not leaving without some answers. I haven't been in much actual pain for a couple of weeks, but my leg is stiff and weak enough that running is still not possible."
"Let’s use the example of a intention to illustrate what this means — this will be useful since intentions are crucial to the whole dialectic between Craig and Schieber. Suppose I intend to eat an apple. My intention has a world-to-mind direction of fit: in order for my intention to be satisfied, the conditions in the world must change in such a way that I consume and digest the apple. But my intention has a mind-to-world direction of causation: the mental state causes those changes to be brought about in the world outside the mind."
"When I was young, my country had a financial recession. My parents were small business owners and had employees. During the recession Dad and Mum did everything they could to pay their team first and whatever was left, if anything, was for our family. My parents have amazing stories of miracle provision during that time. I remember several occasions when I came home from school to find a box of groceries on our doorstep. I watched my parents walk out their faith and trust in God. I watched them closely. And I saw the realness of God and His love and care."

"The system within your body that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance is also involved in bone health. It appears as though a high sodium intake increases the elimination of calcium through the urine. This in turn causes calcium to be leached from the bone with the attending bone loss and increased risk bone fractures. It’s well known that reducing the salt intake has a positive effect on the bodies calcium balance. For this reason, a low-sodium diet may help slow the progression of age-related bone loss. Not only is the skeletal system adversely affected by high sodium, so are your kidneys."

You may have noticed that in her comments on last weeks' post, KATHY over at OREGON GIFTS OF COMFORT AND JOY suggested it might be a good idea to have a Sepia Saturday Facebook Group. It is indeed a good idea and one KAT MORTENSEN had when we first set up Sepia Saturday a couple of years ago. She kindly set up such a group and it has been lying fallow ever since. It can be found by doing a group search for Sepia Saturday or by (hopefully) following THIS LINK. If you use Facebook why not join the group and we can use it to exchange old images and chat about all things sepia. If you don't use Facebook or if you prefer the larger image formats available on Flickr I have also set up a Flickr Sepia Saturday Group which once again we can use to share our images. Again, you should be able to locate it via a group search or (again, hopefully) by following THIS LINK.

"Pat usually never let anything bother her. She was pretty quiet the rest of the night. She smoked a bit more, and drank a bit more. I think I would be chugging a pitcher of beer if it had been me. Of course, we took every opportunity to re-play the evening. It was a spectacular night."

"When composing a persuasive essay, beginning students often spend most of their time emotionally arguing their own position, accumulating research in support of their position, and negating opposition to their argument. However, these methods of argument are often counterproductive. By taking the time to consider who you are trying to persuade – and exactly what you need to convince them of – you will improve your chances of composing a successful argument."

Another meal was cooked in a large pot which is placed in the middle of the table for us to help ourselves, eating it with rice. The pot is choc-full of vegetables and meat swimming in a tasty sauce or broth. As always there are the many interesting, tasty condiments to have with it. In Steve and E's case, the vegetables in the dish come from her parents' market garden. Beautiful, healthy vegetables that are a joy and honour to eat."

"As a family history nerd, this kind of thing normally makes me giddy: my great-grandfather's saw, for example. But I know very little about Shaun's grandmother (she died when he was in college). I know she was extremely frugal, and did not have an easy life. She raised six children without indoor plumbing until the youngest was at least in junior high school. She was not, as I understand it, terribly sentimental, an attribute I tend to attach to everyone in my past, because I am so very sentimental myself. And so, holding her camera, which she took very good care of (she saved the instruction booklet it came with, and had a fine leather case for the camera and her multiple lenses) felt very strange. This woman's grandson is my husband: my daughter is genetically 1/8 her. (Well, mathematically. Or something. I don't know enough about genetics to just leave that sentence unattended). But I just discovered she was a photographer last week. I've never seen one of her photographs, or eaten cookies made from her favorite recipes. I don't know her from anyone. But she raised the man who would raise the man I would marry. It sort of breaks my brain."
"Now, understand something, if I see a post riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes, I can get turned off too. I give the person another chance because maybe they were rushed, maybe they’re new to this whole blogging thing, and I check back in with them for their next post. If the problem continues, I simply don’t read their blog. I simply ‘unfollow’ – what I don’t do is leave sh*tty comments. And I definitely… (and yes, I’m aware I’ve started a sentence with “and” – twice now, in fact) I definitely would NOT leave a sh*tty comment after witnessing only one, ONE, mistake from someone who seems to be a stickler about her writing…from someone who seems to go back to her posts after reading them several times to fix whatever in the hell might be wrong."

"I had heard that Ram Dass had gone down to Brazil to visit Joao’s well-known healing center, known as the Casa, and had had very good things to say about it. He compared the loving, heart-opening atmosphere he discovered there to the feelings he had only experienced previously at his Guru’s ashram in India, although he did not receive any physical healing of the stroke symptoms that had prompted the visit. I told him my story of meeting John of God, and receiving the repeated admonition to head to Brazil. Since Ram Dass had had a positive experience down there, I asked him if he thought it would be worth the trip for me to go. After a brief closed-eye contemplation, he responded, “Given your attitude, I don’t think it would do you any good,” and we both cracked up; it was so clearly the truth about me! I am famous for going to places like that in order to demonstrate that they don’t work for me. I have a reputation to uphold as the 99th Monkey, the proverbial one who never gets it.

I wanted to wear it around my waist, go to school and exert dominance upon my international peers, claiming that I was better and America was number one because the champion of all continents was an American. To me that title meant something, more than just a heavy piece of metal with a fancy design on it. But the years have humbled me* and my patriotism has matured* and now I have an idea of what the belt would mean to me now. As irony would have it, it STILL represents that dominance in a way, but not in a smarmy “I’m better than you” but an inspiring “I’m better than you”."

"The reason is because I thought way back how the media reported that most “Young black and Latino men weren’t going to make it past 18.” We lost a lot of friends during those turbulent 1980s and 1990s, but my best friends and I thought about it and we made it. I thought about how when we were 18 they said, “Young black (and Latino) men won’t make it past 21″ and we did. Then they said, “Young black (and Latino) men won’t make it past 25″ and again, we thought about it and did. Unfortunately, because of the grim picture that the media painted for me. I looked at every birthday for a young urbanite as a game of survival and nothing to be celebrated. In fact, I almost fell into the Westernize trap this year of just thinking of this day as being just a number to dread because it means you’re getting older and closer to death.

"UPDATE: 5th April, 2011. On the RTE Frontline programme last night the new Minister for Justice Equality and Defence Alan Shatter appeared on a panel to discuss this subject. The upshot is that legislation to allow downward reviews in Upward Only Rent Reviews (UORRs) will be presented to the Dail before the summer recess, or shortly afterwards and will be enacted “before the end of this year”. It is unclear if the legislation will be backdated, that is there may be a refund due to the tenant for historical rents and it is also unclear how market rents will be determined – the eligibility for using the new legislation and the arbitration process for examples – but it seemed clear from last night’s programme that tenants felt the present arbitration process was biased towards landlords."

"Osip Mandelstam's continuing hold over readers far from his homeland is shown by the publication of a new book of English-language translations of his work. In a review of Ecco Press' Stolen Air: Selected Poems of Osip Mandelstam for the Washington Post, Michael Dirda quotes Mandelstam's claim that 'Only in Russia' is poetry properly 'respected', because only in Russia is poetry 'so common a motive for murder'. Borges might have smiled sadly at that piece of irony."
"One final point worthy of mention is the artwork produced for the project by Scrying Eye Games. I've used two of the pieces here, with ArmChairGeneral's permission. As can be seen, it has a great antique feel, suggestive of etchings, and it brings a darker mood. I've mentioned the homebrew effect of the earlier elements in the system, but that's much less obvious this time round. The leatherbound effect on the cover works well too, and even the design of the page edging is a variation on that in the earlier documents. In the few months since I first looked at an ArmChairGeneral product, things have come a long way. The ambition isn't letting up and the results are clear to see."

"Singapore should learn from the targeted immigration policy adopted by Silla and focused on getting immigrants who can integrate more easily into our society such as those from the southern provinces of China, Hong Kong and Taiwan of which a basic command of the English language is a must instead of accepting everybody indiscriminately like Balhae without studying if they are culturally, ethnically and linguistically compatible with native Singaporeans in the first place."

"For answer Hilda swirled towards the road. For one awful moment she feared she’d forgotten her wand at home, but after a slight fluster of “Where?” and “Boo!” she produced it with a flourish. Focusing very hard on the curved shape and luxurious colors of human coaches, she gently flicked her wand. The road trembled slightly as a giant, and garishly orange vehicle appeared."
"As she struggles to uncover who her family has really been running from, she is forced to hide her birthmark that reveals who she is. With new realities surfacing, unexplained powers appearing, and two tempting boys vying for her heart, Jewel battles to learn who she can trust in an ever growing sea of lies, hoping she’ll make it through her seventeenth birthday alive."
"For me, it’s less about looking for an impetus to create than finding the strength to follow it through. It takes an enormous amount of work once the fire has caught to focus that flame and keep it burning. This is my job as a director and at times it’s beyond exhausting. To be clear, exhausting is when you are running on (and running low in) your own inner resources. Beyond exhausting is when you have to go outside yourself to find the necessary fuel to keep the project going. It’s at those moments that I think about the audience. Not just the one I hope will see the piece I’m working on, but audiences I have known and loved. The couple who along with their serene seeing-eye dog navigated the obstacle course of a dilapidated midtown theatre to come to a new play from Argentina; a Chinese immigrant over-the-moon from seeing a multi-ethnic cast do a western classic; a seemingly disinterested twelve year-old who, during a Broadway student-matinee, added his own line of dialogue “Again!” just to bolster Juror #8’s climactic “It’s eleven to one.” I want to be true to these people."

"Then there were those times I would excuse myself from whatever was going on at that moment (work, hanging out with friends, running errands, playing with Emily, sleep, etc) and lock myself in a room (or bathroom) with the pump. When Emily was ten months old I was very ready to be done pumping. I was sick and tired of being hooked up to the pump several times a day. But, there were many times when I remember thinking, ""This is only temporary. This is only temporary. This isn't going to last forever."""

Someone will need a toilet, or food, or a bandaid, or won't be able to find their drink bottle/hat/shoes, or need a breastfeed (only Diddy requires the breastfeeding just for the record). Just getting everyone into the car and buckled up takes a good fifteen minutes. Putting Diddy in and fitting the mask + turning on the machine takes about 10 of those 15 mins. She hates it and has worked out that she can self remove quite easily. So I have to hold her little arms down till she goes to sleep or have whoever is sitting next to her pin her arms down."

She sold girl scout cookies, hung out with my son so he would not have to go to the girl scout meeting, and watched both kids as I ran around doing my cookie mom duties. Another one of the many things I love about my MIL is that she is a whiz with crafts. She helped me learn how to use my new sewing machine and she taught me how to make a really cool scarf.This morning I woke up and looked around the house. Although Monday morning my house looked looked like a frat house (only it looked like the frat boys had a huge crafting party)."

"Ok, so I have been thinking what new things I can do to reduce my impact on the Earth. I was casually reading over at The Organic Sister and came across the idea of cloth bathroom wipes. Of course! When I had babies, they wore cloth diapers and I washed them. No problem and no trash. I use a Keeper instead of disposable feminine products. No trash created there. So why do I use toilet paper which get flushed, sits in the septic tank, and then goes to the landfill? Because I never thought about it. Now that I have, I am using cloth there too!"
"Set in the Swiss alps, 'E'enfant D'en Haut' - which carries the English title 'Sister' - is about a young boy called Simon (Kacey Mottet Klein) who escapes his grim life in a tower block by spending his days in the affluent mountain ski resort above, where he steals expensive ski equipment to sell on to local kids. Director Ursula Meier's film has a strong undercurrent of grim socio-economic reality behind it, however it's also lyrical and occasionally whimsical - as Simon strikes the pose of a flush, big-time hustler to great comic effect."

"Overly-familiar lunch scene:"
"When we lived in our cottage on Poplar Street, there was a continuous stream of cats that adopted our humble abode. Because I am extremely allergic to them, I never encouraged them to stay, but I soon realized that they couldn’t care less what I thought. So they came. They stayed long enough to be given names, then they left. My beloved often joked that we were part of some cat hobo network, and we must have received good ratings from the previous cats who lived with us. Great. Its one thing to be a good hostess to friends and family, but I really didn’t need the pressure of pleasing feral cats."
"This album has become one of my favorites of hers. I just love the lushness and simplicity of the arrangements and instrumentation, the coloration added by the stray jazzista solo. A violin solo here, funky organ chords, trap kits played with brushes, and a voice like velvet. It's quite possible that the estimable Walter Wanderley is on organ here too. A repertoire that covers some classic composers of Brazilian romantic song and samba canção, bossa nova, and music from elsewhere in Latin America -- her recording of ""Quizas, quizas, quizas"" was actually among the first handful of versions of this song that would end up being recorded probably hundreds of times (including many anglicized versions) The album closes with one of the most poetic tunes in the Brazilian canon, by the master of 'seresta' ou 'serenata', Silvio Caldas - somebody whose work I have really been getting into: ""Chão de Estrelas"" was his signature song and a master composition, and Maysa gives it a royal treatment here."

"So, to take these in turn: the continuity of it inequality is hidden from us by a constant blather directed at us about lottery winners, achievement, self-improvement, success, rags to riches stories and the like. A martian could be forgiven for thinking that our society is like a saucepan full of boiling peas, with the peas on the bottom racing to the top and the peas on the top racing to the bottom, all in some kind of joyous bubbly circulation. The metaphor couldn't be more wrong. Much more accurate would be something like a moussaka with its thick creamy crusty layer on top and a huge chunk of spiced minced lamb underneath."
"The DOL’s recent decision to withdraw its “updates” to the FLSA yesterday was made in response “to thousands of comments expressing concerns about the effect of the proposed rules on small family-owned farms.” Therefore, instead of revising the FLSA so as to make child labor laws in agricultural and non-agricultural businesses equal as it intended, the DOL announced that it would “work with rural stakeholders — such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, the Future Farmers of America, and 4-H — to develop an educational program to reduce accidents to young workers and promote safer agricultural working practices.”"

Toward the end of the day, some muscle in my left foot began to hurt and I had to take some vitamin I. Come on body…catch up, we’re hiking again! Eventually, I made it the 20 miles back to Lake Morena where some exceptionally awesome trail angels, the Andersons, had stayed and made chili for all the hikers. They even made veggie chili and had cold beer waiting! It was most excellent, especially to be greeted with a giant hug."

"I grew more than I expected over the course of the program. There were moments when I hated it and many moments where I was burned out and thought about quitting.

I found the program to be immensely useful and practical; I come away with many good counseling tools."

It is nice to have everything put away, even if it is in a place that I do not want it. For example, there is no linen closet in the house. So I have linens in Sam’s closet and in my closet. I really would like them all together, and preferably not in my room, but sometimes you get what you get. Today we get small closets and not much storage. It’s good that we didn’t bring all of our junk, I mean, that I got rid of all our junk."

"However, down to their final strike yet again, the Cardinals managed to come back from the dead. Rangers manager Ron Washington brought in veteran Darren Oliver to try and close out the game in the tenth. It was an interesting choice by Washington since Oliver is mainly a setup/situational pitcher, not necessarily someone who you want closing out a huge playoff game. Oliver promptly gave up two singles and a sacrifice bunt pushed them to second and third. Washington brought in reliever Scott Feldman (who should have started the inning). Ryan Theriot grounded out, scoring Daniel Descalso, and then Feldman intentionally walked Albert Pujols to bring up Lance Berkman. Berkman hit a two strike single to score John Jay to tie the game. Watching the action, it seemed like even though the Rangers got out of the inning with a tied score, they were deflated and on the verge of losing."

"Why? Personally I think it comes down to two things – training and organization. We certainly have athletes in this country of 350 Million people, with the physical attributes necessary to put up the same type of marks all the athletes I’ve listed once did. But somehow we’re not identifying, nurturing and developing those athletes – in large part because, in my opinion, we lack the organization to do so. The old Eastern Bloc programs of East Germany and the Soviet Union were the epitome of identification and development of athletes. Today, Jamaica has focused in on sprinting identifying athletes early and funneling them to their best programs. We in contrast have not changed from the days of the Eastern Bloc to now – we are still relying on individuals to rise to the top on their own. That’s why the Eastern Bloc made it so hard on us in the 70’s and 80’s; why the African nations have virtually run us off the podium in the middle and long distances; and why Jamaica has “caught up” to us in sprinting."

"on another subject the shooting in sanford is not a racial issue they made it one and most of the people complaining and causing problems dont even live here and as usual collage kids think they are right and everbody else is wrong. believe me if there was a case the man would be in jail for sure. and for the record any fight is for your life because anytime someone attacks another person there is a chance of a death. ie saw 2 12 year old kids fighting one fell to the ground and the other kick him in the head, the boy died next day in hospital. (was friends with my kid) the aggressure was charged with the crime, the 2 were best freinds and were arguing over who skated better. point being death is never an accident there is always cause and effect. the problem here is some one wants a racial issue and they are not getting their way. besides in orlando and surrounding areas we are averaging 3 to 4 shootings a day, 75 percent involve young black males. dont see the white cummunity out protesting for their rights and safety. by what has come out looks like the young man tried to attack the armed citizen and paid the price. i have to say i have been followed and threated by young black males more than once, if they ever decided to jump me so to speak i would defend my self by any means nessary. and believe it would be a life or death struggle this is life not UCF or WWE its real life. Race, color or creed meen nothing if you decide to take from me. There is no substute for total victory. regardless this sanford shooting is just a excuse for racial tensions and the usual suspects are checking in and collecting their share of fame. it desgracful how the public is treating this and the media has egged it on. this will turn it to some bill to limit gun ownership and make people scared to defend them self. they have a rule out as well called justifable use of deadly force, not saying go out and be the want to be policeman. i am saying stand up and be a man, if your wrong admit it and stop blaiming your problems on other people or the color of your skin. but remember if you like to fight or want to fight or attack someone it can and will cost you your life at some point. the hardest thing for any human to do is to take a life it lives with you for ever and is a heavy burden to carry for anyone. let the law work and then decide if your point of view is right or wrong, and ask youself is your opion is worth you life and physically fighting for. or maybe justice was served that night not our place to judge its the court and the law."
"Really dude? ‘ISPs need to improve bandwidth quickly?‘ I’m sure the executives will get right on that after reading your asinine post. And it’s f—ing idiot fan boys like this moron that really piss me off. I remember the 90′s, when fast internet connections started to proliferate. ISPs clung to their bandwidth like conservatives cling to Fox talking points. When it looked like the gaming revolution would eat up a lot of their precious bandwidth they discussed ways to block games from accessing their networks. They still cling to their bandwidth like Donald Trump’s balding, empty head does to his toupee; for dear life. A single Hi-Def movie is roughly 3.5 GB in data. Multiply that by Netflix’s customer base and that’s roughly 84,000,000 GB of data. Your ISP currently freaks out when you use more than 2 GB of data. You do the math."

"I called her dear in the title because she is my friend and she is sweet. And because she, being English, is so polite that every comment she makes to me she begins with Dear PMAO… (I thought at first that this stood for ‘Pondering My Ass Off’ or some other such clever saying… after seeing LMAO so many times…, but at last I realized… because she explained it to me… that she meant me…Pouring My Art Out."
"Mike turned on the hot water and stood picking remnant sleep from his left eye as the water heated. He always had an enormous amount of sleep on his lashes that seemed to multiply in the first 20 minutes of being awake. Today was no different and frustrated he grabbed the wash cloth again and rubbed hard at his eyes before looking back at the wispy lashes that used to be full and beautiful. After years of this ritual the lashes could no longer manage to grow at the pace in which Mike destroyed them with violent wipes across his brow each day and the incessant picking that accompanied his hours in the desk chair."
"Third and finally, syncretism hasn’t stopped. As this series on Antinous should demonstrate, the end of the late antique period and the so-called “triumph” of Christianity did not stop the tide of new ideas and perceptions about Antinous. Artists, scholars, and art restorers began to see him in new ways and to give shape to him in new forms…Raphael’s Jonah is based on Antinous, for crying out loud! (Though, perhaps, a Jewish prophet-Antinous syncretism might not be the most useful divine image to pursue…!?!) We are a very different human race that is alive and thriving now than what was found in the late antique Mediterranean. Chances are, we all (at least in the U.S.) know people who are of Irish descent, and yet that culture had little to no direct contact with Rome during that period. We probably all know some people of Asian descent–from the Far East of China and Japan, the Southeast of Vietnam and Thailand, or from India and a variety of other places–and while many of these cultures did have trade contacts with Rome and the Greek East, nonetheless they were not visible and prevalent in many places. Though most of North Africa, and some deeper parts of it, were known and conquered by Greeks and Romans, people of African descent were not extremely common in Europe of late antiquity. And, forget entirely about people of Native and Central American descent–these continents weren’t even known to exist! And yet, here we are, living on one of them, intermingling with people of every possible origin on a daily basis. And, it’s wonderful. Whatever we might think about Neil Gaiman’s American Gods, the idea that every group of people brought their gods with them to America (including Antinous) is one that I think many modern pagans can get behind. Gods of the classical world certainly don’t seem to have any difficulty contacting people here, and gods of elsewhere in the world seem to have done likewise. This being the case, the idea that any pantheon of deities is somehow existing in closed corridors or in a divine conclave that just hovers above their own devotees and never even has a window open on its divine neighbors is, in my mind at least, ludicrous. The gods have always been as promiscuous as humans can be, and as gregarious, and as multi-faceted and interdisciplinary and multimedia and equally fascinated. The gods are not a fixed and unchanging quantity–if they were, they would never have been able to make it out of a local context. Zeus would have remained an obscure deity revered in a cave on Crete, perhaps. But, that’s not the reality we’ve observed in ancient history, and it certainly can’t be the reality we witness today. New gods will appear, new forms of old gods will emerge, forgotten gods will re-emerge gradually, and syncretized forms of gods will come about at various times and for various reasons."

"As far as interacting with us and his brother and sisters, every day is better and better. We have days where he is less ""smiley"" and seems distant, but he has been home for less than a month and has been through so much change. We are constantly reminded that it will just take time. He also flinches and screams/crys less and less with any type of hygiene/routine care such as wiping his face, cutting his nails, diaper changes, etc... I can tell he is beginning to trust us more. I must whisper, ""Mommy will be gentle"" to him at least 20 times a day!"

As most couples do, we have different TV viewing preferences, though we will often watch a movie we like together, usually in bed, or in the living room. I don't visit the man cave very often."
"We had an option of joining the normal membership. Or the ""upgraded"" membership which means we get ONE towel per visit. One towel?? What is this? I had a roommate that used to steal the towels from NYSC to clean our apartment! Equinox was a towel party (a eucalyptus smelling towel party I might add). I didn't realize thin, rough towels were such a commodity here. We opted to not pay the extra 200 euros a year for a towel."

Saul of Tarsus was the most dangerous man on earth as far as the followers of Jesus Christ were concerned. When one becomes a Christian he takes on new leadership. We accept Christ as personal Saviour because the world fails us. Why, then, would we want to go back to man for advice and leadership?"

"As a mom, I’m always looking for healthy alternatives to old favorites. While not a dramatically long list, I’ve tried chickpea cookies, almond flour cake, golden flaxseed meal pancakes, and now coconut flour brownies. Why coconut flour? It’s gluten-free, high in fiber, and high in protein. And, I found a recipe on the back of the Let’s Do…Organic bag (why not try it, right?). The original was too dry for my family so I changed a few things for more moisture. If you want more good stuff, add 2 tablespoons of chia seeds for a nice dose of Omega-3. It will have bits of crunch but still hold a good chocolate flavor. Finally, as you’ll notice, there’s only a few ingredients so be selective when chooosing cocoa powder and chocolate chunks."
"Anyway, one of the things I’ve found is that families with new babies appreciate food more than anything else you can give them. With that in mind, I made my sister and her husband a giant lasagna to keep them well-fed for the first few days home from the hospital. With my perfect nephew."
"2. They think they've changed the rules to make it much more difficult to earn a flight. This is a little true, but not worthy of outrage. On a dollar-for-dollar basis, it now takes 10 roundtrip flights to earn an equivalent free flight (instead of 8). Note I said ""equivalent"". That means you can't shuttle from Tampa to Ft. Lauderdale 8 times, then earn a free round trip to Portland, OR. You shuttle 10 times, then get your 11th shuttle (or equivalent) free."

"That was never a very good argument. Gaddafi has never treated the military well, because he feared a coup. In part, that explains why sections of the military placed themselves in the head of the rebellion in Benghazi – many of these same people have been developing relations with Imperialism for some considerable time. Moreover, the Egyptian military was much more powerful than Gaddafi's, but it was neutralised. Indeed, it had been not only neutralised but turned in Benghazi."

"My left eyelid just doesn't like to rise up to the occassion. It was pointed out in front of me a hundred times as a child, maybe that is where the insecurity about it stemmed from.

"Life goes in seasons and it was after about 6 years with that church that I lost Gods vision for my life. I created my own vision based on what I thought was more important to me. I had allowed the hard times to get bigger than God in my head and that wore me out quicker than anything. Yes, in case you didnt know, when you are planting a church you almost always have to work another job to pay the bills. In my case, I had gotten up to working three jobs and was still basically broke. I had a wife, and 3 kids. I was living in my father in laws house. I had school debt. I had medical bill debt. My life looked nothing like what I had always pictured in my head. Nothing. Thats when I dropped church. Thats when I said to myself “I have been living my life in sacrifice to others and their ministries for years and got nothing back. I cant even rent an apartment!!”. Thats when I started MY vision for MY life. Guess what? My vision didnt work out so well. I was working to make my first million before turning 30 and I was well on the way. In a couple months the business I had started with a good friend was in staring down contracts with ABC Disney and Clear Channel Radio. That part was looking good. However, I was never home. I didnt talk to my wife. I hardly spent any quality time with my kids. I was just working. Without going into all the junk that followed, I will just say this. I hit my rock bottom and God was again the first thing on my mind. It was then when He began to restore me."

"Otto Warburg won a nobel prize in 1931 for discovering that cancer cells are hypoxic, or low in oxygen. He formulated the metabolic deviation of malignant tissue from normal tissue by comparing anaerobic glycolysis to cell respiration.Research Scientist Dr. Merrill Garnett used this platform plus thirty years of his life’s work to discover the lipoic acid/palladium (LAPd) complex, sold as Poly-MVA. It kills cancer cells by transferring electron energy to a hypoxic cell’s metabolic cycle. This is done in part by targeting the PDH enzymes, a primary source of tumor-specific alteration to energy metabolism.German Physician Ryke Geerd Hamer, originator of THE NEW MEDICINE explains how cancer can originate from a severe, highly acute-traumatic, and isolative conflict shock-experience. The content of the conflict arises associatively, is set up through involuntary thoughts, and the when the shock occurs, it goes right past the filter of our intellectual understanding. I used to think I was smart because I had learned stuff about cancer. Used to think I was pretty cool when I could rattle stuff off about my treatments and health. I used to think it was funny that I knew more about glioblastomas than my oncologist. I thought it all nice and dandy that you have to be your own doctor these days.

"Here’s the point. Everyone has a story, and every story is worth telling. Every person alive on the planet today has a unique set of circumstances and life experiences that sets them apart from all others; each one an original, like a strand of DNA encoded in a one of a kind, God-created, ultra-unique fashion. With the world’s population at somewhere around seven billion, it’s easy to simply take people for granted and watch them flow by us in an endless river of humanity and pay no attention to the thoughts in their minds, the feelings of their hearts or the condition of their souls. Doing so doesn’t make us wrong or insensitive, but I believe we need to stop every once in a while and consider a couple of things. First, no two of us are the same. The Bible tells us that God has created each of us in His own image, and yet we’re completely different from each other, with differing personalities and spirits. (That to me is mind-blowing in itself.) Every person alive has a God-ordained purpose to discover, develop and deliver to humanity. Second, we’d do ourselves and each other a great service to consider where people are coming from and where they are going. What do I mean by this? Consider the person you encounter in the checkout line at the grocery store during your daily routine: Are they happy? Are they struggling with something? Do they know how special they truly are in the eyes of God or do they feel worthless and without hope? Does the police officer driving his patrol car secretly wish he could bring someone some ‘good’ news every once in a while? Does the over-zealous professional lie awake at night wishing he or she would actually spend the necessary time it takes to develop a healthy relationship with their spouse and children? What about the recently unemployed, middle-aged drive thru attendant at your local fast food joint; do they have a dream of accomplishing something amazing that has been squelched over time by eroding winds of life? How often do we cross paths with someone who has just experienced something wonderful in life and just wants to explode with joy, but has no immediate outlet to do so? How about the homeless man pushing his entire life around in a shopping cart? What brought him to this place in life? Was he always there? Does he have a family; and if so where are they now? If he doesn’t, what happened to them? Does he ever feel loved?"

"Jack trails behind picking up a stone here, a twisted piece of wood there, metal with a small rainbow crossing it's center... little prizes, relics collected and stuffed into the pockets of his jeans, hanging loosely on his small frame. The right leg ripped just below the knee on the outer part, there is a scab where he fell and tore his pants yesterday. His shirt just as scruffy looking, covered already with the morning dust, a red smear from his jelly toast across the left sleeve, and the old stain from the warm cocoa he spilled down the front of himself last week when Toby jumped up to his lap trying to share the drink with him. Toby darts back and forth between us, checking on Jack, exploring the brush along the side of the trail and running ahead, insuring the trail is okay for us to proceed. Her reddish brown fur glimmers as a small ray of sunlight breaks through the fog where she nudges her muzzle through the bushes to take a long drink from the icy cold pool near the springs. It seems so strange how when Toby's fur becomes damp from the thick air and dewdrops on the bushes, it darkens, almost to the auburn color of the mop on Jack's head. Jack's curls look like chocolate swirled, hanging loosely against the tan shirt draped over his tiny shoulders."

A huge pull to take flight south to where he is, cuddled in his mama's arms...It's work for women to raise up a future generation and now I have a little work to do within the pleasure of getting to know him.

"Granted, there aren't a lot of brown-colored people in hockey, and not too terribly many in those freakishly cold and god-forsaken countries (e.g., Canada, Russia). I suspect a good reason for this is that brown-colored people are smart enough to realize that the cold and ice are not aphrodisiacs and any countries where winter is defined as “not July” are not worth living in. But seriously – I can't respect a sport where a 1950s sentiment is not atypical."

It’s SO much more motivating to work out with a friend – we talked the whole time and it flew by.

It constantly fascinates me the roles we take on, and the twists that occur sometimes…But these are songs I just chose to put on the record cause I wanted to get them out there, and together, they did, kind of create this story."

"Ironically, the deciding factor for us was finding out that Finn has Down syndrome. Because he has Down syndrome, he (supposedly) already has a “compromised” immune system. This fact alone seems to spur a lot of parents to definitely go forward with vaccines. It made me even more gun-shy of getting him immunized. In my mind, I couldn’t help but remember that my pediatrician has always wanted to delay vaccines if one of my children were sick when they were due for vaccines, exactly because it wasn’t a good idea to put toxins into the bodies of children whose immune systems were compromised by illness. Seven months after Finn was born, my husband was diagnosed with Stage III colorectal cancer, and throughout his treatment, our kids could not receive live-virus vaccines because Michael’s indirect exposure could prove very dangerous to him while his immune system was compromised by chemo. That said a lot to me, too. Vaccines are not entirely benign; they can be dangerous."
"The left-wing socialist leader Largo Caballero had demanded in June that the workers be armed, but was refused by Azaña. When the coup came, the Republican government was paralyzed. Workers armed themselves in Madrid and Barcelona, robbing government armories and even ships in the harbor, and put down the insurrection while the government vacillated, torn between the twin dangers of submitting to Franco and arming the working classes. In large areas of Spain, effective authority passed into the hands of the anarchist and socialist workers who had played a substantial, generally dominant role in putting down the insurrection."

Then of course there’s the suggestion that Twitter is “crack for the easily distractible” (apologies to whoever tweeted that remark, I didn’t have the wit to favourite it and I'm yet to discover a time-efficient way of swimming upstream to fish it out again.) Whatever one’s view, it is clear that Twitter and other media/ social media/ electronic networks are capable of transforming the way in which humans engage with information, ideas and possibly even with each other – or at least those humans with access to the web who are willing to spend considerable portions of time to splashing about in this virtual paddling pool."

The first scene opens with Eminem’s “Slim Shady” playing in the background, and you understand why the instant you see Schmidt, who looks like a bloated version of the troubled rapper, who, might I add, had pretty much disappeared from the face of the earth by 2005. His glory days took place during my freshman year in 2002, but perhaps that’s the whole point of Schmidt’s image: He’s way behind on the times and out of style:"

First to speak was Fredericka Argent (IFPI), who took the audience through the problems in copyright enforcement which led to the passage of the UK's Digital Economy Act 2010. The Act was predicated on statements in EU Directives to the effect that internet service providers (ISPs) were often better placed than copyright owners to deal with infringements. Fredericka explained the basis of the Act's graduated response to file-sharing. Using date-and-time stamps, ISPs can identify which subscriber is the owner of an IP address at the time of infringement, which enables the right person to be targeted. Once targeted, responses can be ratcheted up, from educational notifications to full-blown legal action."

"However the need to have this bodywork forming the floor has been exploited and the splitter now forms aerodynamic and chassis functions of its own. As the term suggests the splitter separates the airflow passing under the raised nose between that which passes above and below the floor, equally its boats ‘bow’ shape above where it meets the monocoque also splits the airflow passing over the floor between left to right. Air then spills off the upper surface of the splitter and some of this will make its way under the floor and towards the splitter, thus the teams make use of this powerful flow to alter the pressure distribution across the underfloor to further improve airflow through the diffuser. allied to the fences, vortex generators and previously bargeboards, the splitter forms a critical role in the onset flow for the diffuser."

"Juxtaposing passages from the New Testament and ancient Buddhist scriptures, this book illuminates the striking similarity between the lives, deeds, and teachings of the two prophets. It uncovers the strange and unexplained parallels between Jesus's sermons, Buddha's sayings, and the koans of Zen Buddhist masters. The sayings of Jesus and Buddha are often nearly identical. At the heart of these amazing parallels lie two mysteries. How could Jesus, living 500 years after Buddha in a land 3,000 miles from India, teach the same ideals? Some historians believe that Buddhist principles were known throughout the Roman Empire, other theorists claim that Jesus was trained in Buddhism, and some even think he visited India. This one relates to the book I checked out last week: Living Buddha, Living Christ. Three of us plan to discuss that book, and I want to read more on the subject. It's kind of like being in school, studying the subject as well as reading the main book. I enjoy that sort of thing. Do you?"

Grassley also bests Harkin with independents, 50-34 versus 39-45."

"Because the inner planets cooled in a progression inversely proportional to their distance from the sun, number four was the first to cool to the point where life could arise. The later inhabitants of number three who invented those belt names called this planet MARS, after their god of war, because in their time from their planet's surface number four appeared reddish, the color of their blood, a prominent feature of warfare. Thus, the logic behind the applied name. Well, at least they didn't call it ""something belt."""

"Well, it was no surprise when he asked for my number. And he called me a few days later, and we saw a Woody Allen film, and then we went out for dinner and talked and talked and talked (and he told me the 11 plus story). And we've been talking pretty much non stop for the last twenty years, although it took us three years to get around to getting married, because believe me, nothing makes my husband go at any pace except his own. Which is one of the many things that I love about him, even as I am infuriated."
"With my oldest preparing to leave for college in the fall, I find myself thinking back to those “snuggle time” days a lot lately. I can still feel their heads lean against me, the sound of sippy cups as I read, their chubby toddler hands resting on my arm, and I am so, so grateful that I took the time to do that when they were young. I did it for them—because as a teacher, I knew how important it was for them to grow up with books being an everyday part of life. I also knew, that when children sit on your lap to read books, they associate reading with something pleasant/positive and that feeling is something they carry in their cells right into adulthood. Besides, books are fun, aren't they?!"
"Something Like Normal by Trish Doller: This one comes out in June, but seriously, do not miss it. Just preorder it now. I read it straight through, then reread it the next day, and read my favorite parts the day after. I couldn't pick up another book for about a week or more after, this book got to me that much. It is absolutely, undeniably extraordinary. This book shattered me, put me back together, then broke me just a little more. Travis is, in a lot of ways, a jerk... but he's also intensely loyal and caring and straightforward. He is a mess in his own right, and wanting to get past that. Watching the changes he goes through in this book are aching and so realistic, and then add in the romance and the way it develops, with this slow yet gripping burn... and this book is just breathtaking."

How often do you hear about people extolling the kindness of people in New York, much less the transit authority’s employees? Never. The rudeness of New Yorkers is well known and well respected because it shows that they are real people who don’t give a fuck if you want a smile when you walk by them because they shouldn’t need to smile at every damn person they see. When I hear someone say that the people on another city’s transit smiled at them, then I just have to wonder where their bubble is because apparently living in one is what they expect."

"Samuel Beckett's first play, Eleutheria, mirrors his own search for freedom, revolving around a young man's efforts to cut himself loose from his family and social obligations. His first real triumph, however, came on January 5, 1953, when Waiting for Godot premiered at the Théâtre de Babylone. In spite of some expectations to the contrary, the strange little play in which ""nothing happens"" became an instant success, running for four hundred performances at the Théâtre de Babylone and enjoying the critical praise of dramatists as diverse as Tennessee Williams, Jean Anouilh, Thornton Wilder, and William Saroyan who remarked, ""It will make it easier for me and everyone else to write freely in the theatre."" Perhaps the most famous production of Waiting for Godot, however, took place in 1957 when a company of actors from the San Francisco Actor's Workshop presented the play at the San Quentin penitentiary for an audience of over fourteen hundred convicts. Surprisingly, the production was a great success. The prisoners understood as well as Vladimir and Estragon that life means waiting, killing time and clinging to the hope that relief may be just around the corner. If not today, then perhaps tomorrow."

"In my case, I remember how this sense of ownership manifested itself on one occasion. I'd read in a weekend magazine that one of my literary heroines, Maya Angelou, had just collaborated with Hallmark on a series of cards bearing her inspiring poetry. I recall feeling betrayed and even if I didn't go online to pour bile on the ""people's poet"" and her alleged ""treason"", inside me there was a little voice shouting out: ""Sellout! Sellout!"" But sell out to whom? Maya is Maya is Maya is Maya. The poems she contributed to Hallmark's regular middle-of-the-road output might not have had, in my humble opinion, the same quality of her masterpieces ""Still I Rise"" or ""Phenomenal Woman"" but they were still better than the usual crop Hallmark produces. That was, as I mentioned before, many years ago. The other day I read an interview with her in the paper where she was telling a journalist that she had just written a cookery book. She then went on to explain how some people thought it strange that she had decided to venture down a road that was so far from her main occupation, that is, to write poems. Presumably, and this is pure speculation, these people - amongst them, critics - considered cooking a less worthy activity than poetry. However, I remember thinking after I finished reading her interview that if there was one person in the world for whom the word ""cooking"" was created, that person was Maya Angelou."

Because they lost the likes of Nnamdi Asomugha, Zach Miller, Robert Gallery & Thomas Howard to free agency last season, they are now owners of compensatory 3rd, 4th, and 5th round picks. This injects hope into an previously barren draft; Oakland had only two picks (5th & 6th rounders) going into Monday, so this news gives new GM Reggie McKenzie a punchers chance of finding quality, NFL starting talent at multiple positions."

"Before the Act, IP that was developed at institutions such as universities was dealt with under the general IP statutes, such as the Patents Act 1978, the Designs Act 1993, and the Copyright Act 1978. The new legislation is of utmost significance to research institutions, as well as to any entity that is considering embarking on collaborations with such institutions or even with individuals at such institutions. In every case where there is use of public finance, for example in the form of professors' wages, office space, use of facilities, or use of existing IP, the Act will kick in. Potential donors and collaborators need to be alert to the fact that even if they are contributing significant resources to a research project with a local university or institution, anything less than funding on a full cost model, will result in a severe curtailment of the ability of the funder to decide on the status of the resultant IP."

"There are two categories of materials you need for making compost, and for the sake of simplicity, we'll call them greens (which supply nitrogen) and browns (which supply carbon). Greens are the wet nitrogen filled materials like grass clippings, kitchen waste and fresh manures. Browns are dry things like paper, cardboard and straw. You will need 30 browns (carbon) to one green (nitrogen). Now that might sound complicated but all it means is that you need much more dry material like paper and straw than you need greens. Everything you add to the heap should be small. Chop up the scraps, cardboard etc with your garden spade before adding. The smaller it is, the faster it will decompose. BTW, if you don't have enough kitchen scraps to make a compost heap, chop up your kitchen waste and bury it in the garden. It will decompose and add to the fertility of the soil."
"Besides games, my other choices are TV shows, because they’re short enough to sit down and watch with dinner without feeling like you’re committing several hours of time to, and because they’re comfortably familiar. In particular, I’ve lost count of the number of times that I’ve watched Black Books and Spaced. Spaced in particular, for me, represents possibly the very best of British television. It’s clever, it’s funny, it’s well-written and above all, it’s evergreen. It’s still just as relevant today as it is now, though watching it as a slightly older person changes my perspective on it somewhat. Black Books, on the other hand, represents the other extreme of what British comedy does well – the bizarre and the uncanny. Black Books makes absolutely no sense and thus, going by past experience, it utterly confuses Americans. Admittedly I base this assumption on the fact that my brother found it really funny and my sister-in-law didn’t get it at all, so it may be a somewhat hasty conclusion. But if you want to switch your brain off and enjoy some purely comic situations, there’s few things that will beat it."

Most of the travel time taks about 1-2 hours. The day-trip tour cost about 500,000Rupiah for the entire van rent but gasoline and toll fees not included."

"Usually, when I style for a client, I do all the shopping and returns. I schlep everything to my client's home and schlep everything back that doesn't end up getting used. I had the luxury of sending Rachel on her own shopping excursion. She sent me photos of the spaces she wanted to get photos of, and I directed her to specific items in specific styles and colors. It was a little difficult to give up shopping control, because a lot of times I just don't know what will work until I see it. But Rachel did a great job. And I was not sad to miss out on making returns (my most un-favorite part of styling gigs.)"
"""At the time Beth and I married, Karla was in the throes of her disabilities, Bipolar and Borderline Personality disorder, which left her in some ways to struggle with forever being a child herself, subject to whim or sudden changes of heart. Like a balloon adrift on the wind, she would step out to pick something up from the grocery store and not come back for literally a year or more. This is not to diminish Karla as shallow or careless. Karla had an extraordinarily deep and tender soul. Inasmuch as she struggled to breach the threshold of her illnesses, she had a depth of feeling and understanding that was wise many times beyond her years. The pain of birthing children and ultimately having to let them go, to be raised by someone else, gave Karla a depth of insight that few people have on what a privilege it is to be a parent. It was something she ached for. Children, having them, loving them, wanting the best for them were at the core of her being. And though she was always openly thankful to us, it was always her aspiration to break through one day and to recover some of the years of parenting she had missed."

"Hadley was so fun to read about. She had about a thousand problems and was such a complicated young person, but I loved her. She was so much like me, and most teenage girls. And Oliver, he was so funny and caring. I really loved both of these characters, and even the old lady sitting next to them got me. I think that Jennifer E. Smith really knows how to write wonderful characters that are so exaggerated, yet perfectly believeable."
"Catch phrases, a single word that stands out in your mind, a paragraph, the first line of a poem or maybe the last line of a story. An idea. A good title for a novel. The name for a character. Whatever you write is not important at this point. Just get your thoughts down on paper. In so doing, you clear away the clutter that’s keeping you from seeing the beauty underneath. And quite possibly, you will go back to the four pages in your files and pull a note from the stack of thoughts that will work great in a new creation."

"Poverty is complex. There is no simple solution to the array of problems facing the world’s poor, mainly because the causes of poverty are heterogeneous – there are many of them and they are all related. Cashpor’s female clients and their families are not only income-poor; they are also time- and resource-poor. As women, they are responsible for the domestic chores, like cooking and child care, in addition to being microfinance clients and entrepreneurs – putting a serious burden on their time. Many rural families don’t have access to grid electricity and must instead rely on kerosene or wood-burning stoves for cooking, heating and light. Such poverty often means their daughters are pulled from school at a young age to help raise younger siblings or help the household earn money, stunting their ability to earn a good, reliable living. Grameen Foundation and Cashpor are providing these poor households with access to savings and credit, which are vital steps in addressing this complex issue."
"Finally, a new addition to my every-day carry (EDC) survival load, acquired this weekend, through trade, is a brand-spanking new Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 pocket pistol as a back-up gun (BUG).

It’s not too sweet to eat alone and it’s not too sweet when you fill a well in the center with salted peanut caramel and drizzle the top with dark chocolate, finishing with just a slight sprinkle of sea salt. These are amazing. This is the last recipe you will ever have to try to get the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe!"

"Growing up, my first real feud when I started watching WCW was Sting Vs Flair. They have had numerous matches against each other, they know each other as well as they know the back of their hands. Sadly, this match didn’t live up to their usual standards, but then again that was never the intention. No question, the reason why this match was moved to Impact, and not at the PPV was so they can edit it….just in case. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t tarnish my image of two legends, and Flair should stay with TNA as a mouthpiece for someone."

"But then we move here, and suddenly it’s like I can’t wait to get away from him. I want to work extra hours and not because of the pay. I want to spend all the time I can downstairs at my sisters so I don’t have to talk to him. Or worse, hear him talk. He doesn’t ever want to talk about anything important to us, as a couple, only what he heard on the radio that day or saw on the news or read on line. He’s worked a whole 5 days since November as a temp at the book bindery that my brother in law works at. He’s not looked for a real job since right before Christmas. His car needs a new alternator. His phone bill is out of control. He wants a new this and a new that and he complains all the time about the house (which was built in the 40’s and taken very good care of ever!) is too cold too drafty too…whatever. It snows too much in Wisconsin. It’s too cold for him to go jogging. He wants his own garage. He wants his own laundry room so that I don’t have to go all the way downstairs to use my sister’s. He hates my brother in law (don’t worry, it’s mutual) and doesn’t want to be down there when he’s there. Which makes it pretty hard for him to be down there because my BiL hates for anyone to be over when he’s not home (I dunno, he just does). But that’s okay since I go down there to get away from him anyways!"

"On the wall below the name of the museum, it reads “Using Objects of Intolerance to Teach Tolerance and Promote Social Justice.” As the museum demonstrates, we have a history of racial injustice, and we continue to live in a racially divisive society. The examples are still everywhere. Read the comments about nearly anything relating to President Obama or scroll to the comments section of any online story even remotely referring to race and you are sure to be appalled. In fact, I just read an article today about the hate spilled out toward Joel Ward, the hockey player who scored the winning goal in overtime of game 7 to lead the Washington Capitals over the Boston Bruins, because he is black. However, if we remain solely focused on what is wrong, we lose sight of the true mission of the Civil Rights Movement and of institutions like the Jim Crow Museum. We need to reach out to one another to promote love and acceptance for all, and I truly mean all. This post and the museum are dedicated to discussions of race but they also open the doors to working to overcome all forms of discrimination, stereotyping, and intolerance. One day, hopefully we will be able to actually love all our neighbors as God loves us and live in the type of society that Dr. King dreamed about.

If they're using magic to fly with their wings, there should be the attached magic rules: drain vs. free energy. But if they're flying around and not feeling exertion of any kind, I start to disbelieve that aspect of the worldbuilding. I begin to question and doubt the author's prowess, and then I see that they don't really need to fly at all, do they? And then I begin to question plot and character, which leads me to see that Character A could've easily avoided that plot twist by making a better, obvious decision, which leads to everything unraveling.

"Gary’s house was up a dirt road near the bottom of Deception Gulch, at the low end of town, and looked like a giant nest, wooden stilts almost at mid-tree level holding up the house and porch. As soon as I got out of the car, my ears filled with the music of hundreds of birds and the buzzing of thousands of bees in the forty to fifty trees and flowering vines that had been planted closely around the house. This little oasis contrasted with the rest of the barren hillside that contained old mine tailings, remnants of shacks that had fallen down, hundreds of rusted tin cans, and pieces of pipes and bedsprings. There was a crapper on the porch (though not quite an outhouse) and a refrigerator on the patio."
"The day will end with both the men’s and women’s 400 hurdle finals. After the semis these are more wide open than they appeared at the opening of the meet as some athletes have emerged while some others are not looking as sharp as expected – putting lane assignments in the wspotlight. In the women’s race, lane draw could make a difference as defending champion Melaine Walker (JAM) drew lane eight, and teammate Kaliese Spencer (an early favorite) drew lane two – both off less than stellar semifinal runs. The best of the semis – Lashinda Demus (USA), Zuzana Hejnova (CZE), Natalya Antyukh (RUS) and Vania Stambolova (BUL) will populate lanes three through six. This is going to be a wild one. Lane draw may also determine the outcome of the men’s race, as early favorites L.J. van Zyl (RSA) and Angelo Taylor (USA) will bookend the field in lanes eight and one respectively. Meanwhile those middle lanes will have Javier Culson (PAN), Cornel Fredericks (RSA), Bershawn Jackson (USA) and David Greene (GBR). This will be very interesting. Take note that Taylor’s first ever global medal was Olympic gold in 2000 – out of lane one! Can he repeat that performance in Daegu?"

But quickly before I go... for recording purposes, I'd like to mention that we worked on geometry this week. Jesse, Travis, Savannah, and I sat around the kitchen table with Jesse's 6th grade textbook, playing with angles and 3D shapes, measuring, drawing, and discussing the angles of rollercoasters and rooflines, and how many faces an object had. Travis drew a triangle, and Jesse a cylinder. They needed no help, they drew them quite naturally. Drawing 3D has always been difficult for me... maybe I'll learn now! :)"

"October 4 - Off we went again, this time we took the tube to Westminster station and then caught a boat up the river to Hampton Court Palace. The boat ride is 2 ½ hours. We saw many things that you do not see by train or car. The captain of the boat gave us a nice tour, explaining a lot of the history of sites, and even some homes of celebrities such as Lord Archer’s, Michael Caine, and several others. The boat has a little kitchen, so they served hot drinks, which is needed with the wind off the river at this time of the year. I enjoyed it immensely, and I especially loved seeing all the house boats and the little islands. We visited the palace, and this time saw a lot more of it than the last visit. This time we visited Henry VIII’s apartments and I believe, Queen Anne’s apartments. Afterwards, we walked down the road to Pizza Express where we had a bite and then caught the train back to the hotel, just in time to get ready for the play, Bombay Dreams. Now, that was definitely a highlight of the trip! Bombay Dreams’ music and dancing is just so contagious! When we left the theater, my son and I could not help but sing and dance our way around, hahahaha."
"7. Leave enough time between the arrival date and the wedding. Most gowns can take 4 months to arrive. Most shops ask for 6 months from order date to wedding date. This is not because we’re meanies, this is to stop you getting stressed. Remember you will need fittings once the dress has arrived (and the seamstresses have more than just your gown to alter), remember there are forces outside of our control to contend with. Have you ever seen a bride who left ordering right up until the last point whose dress is now late? I have, it’s a scary sight, don’t be that sight."
"For 31 years I taught young people from fifth grade through high school, knowing I was influencing lives in a positive way. But I was half-way through my career before I realized that I could function in a spiritual way while teaching secular material.

Five years have gone by in the snap of my fingers. Seriously, it feels like it has gone by like a breeze, and I’m feeling appreciative of all the people I have met in those years. Whether they stayed my friend for years to follow, or if they were a buddy when we were in class together, if we dated or if we merely flirted, or if we made out like mad at that one party back in my sophomore year…however I met you, I’m thankful for knowing all these people."
"I find that our French friends have no axe to grind, they accept us as we are and, it seems, that our very reliable English friends out here are the ones that have only had one marriage partner (usually of many, many years). Now I am not being ‘marriage-ist’ but it seems that those who have had multiple marriages/partners seem to be the ones that are ‘not on the level’, are up for gossip, and putting down and ‘gossiping’ about their ‘friends’. My experience shows that those who have just have had one marriage are the truest friends (there are, though, exceptions to the rule as in most things – and you know who you are!)."
"Two weeks ago, I was in Target on a Sunday. Always a bad idea. People were everywhere, and I was close to loosing my mind. Even a short trip for a quick errand had turned epic. Barreling toward the exit, a child darted out in front of me. “Holy crap” was the first thing out of my mouth, then I realized I had not hit the girl. A mother chased after the child, grabbed her by the arm, and shouted at me “you should have hit her. Then she may have learned something” – then smacked the little girl."

"Now the Minister didn’t really answer the question asked of him, which is surprising really, given how expert he was in the workings of NAMA just a month ago when he danced his jig to repay the Anglo promissory note. Irelandis undoubtedly coming under pressure from the ECB to redeem the NAMA bonds which involves NAMA redeeming the bonds with the banks and the banks redeeming the bonds with the ECB which is presently lending funds to the banks secured on the NAMA bonds as collateral. But as our Finnish friend might say “pacta sunt servanda” and the “pacta” that underpin the NAMA bonds say that the bonds don’t need be repaid until 2020 and that they cost NAMA a measly 1.25% at present. And according to the “pacta” that underpin the operation of NAMA, NAMA can use its cash not just to “advance funds to projects, including projects located in Ireland, under the control of its debtors or receivers” as Minister Noonan coyly says above but in accordance with section 2 and 14 of the NAMA Act, can use its funds to support the economy."

I am constantly amazed by the mind and how I can be standing there knowing full well that the ""bad"" guy is paper, can't hurt me and that I know in real life I am going to beat the crap out of anyone trying to hurt me, and yet, some things still takes me right back to that day. The main thing is that I can control it now or at least overcome it. When it was my turn to do the drill, I used all my fear as energy and I was extremely forceful with my punch and I am not sure if it was loud to anyone else, but I think it was the loudest ""GET BACK"" I have ever screamed.

His father had found them after a fire at a business place. The nails had apparently been inside of a box which had acted as a mold to keep the contents intact after the box itself had burned away. The individual nails could still be seen, but they had been fused into the permanent shape they now held."

"The children recognized the poem ""Jabberwocky"" (which Alice reads in the looking glass house) both from reading it in a collection of poetry and from a parody of it in Science Verse by John Scieszka and Lane Smith. Lewis Carroll's poem involved made up words which seem almost sensible. Reading it slowly you can tell which part of speech each word is and that lets you string together the general gist of the poem even while you lack the details. We used to play a game a bit like this where we would take turns pretending to be an extraterrestial and use a few made up words and the other person would have to figure out from context what they were, but in those cases we offered more clues that ""Jabberwocky"" does. I'd like sometime to sit down and write out a couple of variations of ""Jabberwocky,"" replacing some of the made up words with real words but trying to make each variation as different as possible from each other. How would the meaning change if ""vorpal"" (as in vorpal sword) meant ""toy"" in contrast to if it meant ""deadly""? Could ""slithy toves"" that ""gyre and gimble in the wabe"" be bacteria eating and multiplying in the soil? Could it be fairy creatures dancing? Could it be peasants trudging and hauling in the fields? How flexible could those placeholders be? I might also take a different poem and work the other direction, replacing some of its words with made-up words to see how that feels. I also want to revisit the parody again with the children and talk about how knowing the context of it changes the meaning of it. (The parody is about food additives. Is modern food full of additivies something like a looking-glass version of real food?)"

"This pineal gland, also known as our third eye, has been cherished throughout history in ancient cultures. Artwork from Sumeria, to the Mayans and even Egyptian pyramids glorified this magickal gland. We call it “pineal” which derives from “pinecone” and that’s exactly how it looks in the center of our brains. In fact, this gland has all of the inner components of your seeing eyes and may very well be responsible for the visions you have while dreaming. It is filled with fluid, and the balance or imbalance of this fluid is used to detect brain tumors on brain scans. The Hindu Bindi is a decorative gem worn over the third eye, and we still see this all the time in our current society. For those who celebrate the Hindu religion, this pineal gland, or 6th chakra, represents the manifestation of stored energy or Kundalini energy. It’s hidden sacred knowledge. Knowledge from within that culminates when the connection is made through all of the lower chakras. This makes me think of an activated pineal gland as a gift of inner-sight that is rewarded to those who make those connections. We know it’s something desired by many today. Just look at the American dollar bill and you’ll see the third eye symbolism atop a depiction of a pyramid. The Pope carries a pinecone atop his staff and his house, the Vatican, is chock-full of pine cone symbolism and god/goddess relics that one would assume would be hard to find in a Cristian haven. Pinecones are everywhere loves. From corporate logos to religious art to money money money money. And if this post was solely about our pineal glands I could go on forever about how intentional that is."

It would not have surprised them to feel a summer breeze on their faces, or to see the lights among the boughs reduplicated in the arch of a starry sky. The strange solitude about them was no stranger than the sweetness of being alone in it together. At length Lily withdrew her hand, and moved away a step, so that her white-robed slimness was outlined against the dusk of the branches. Selden followed her, and still without speaking they seated themselves on a bench beside the fountain."

"In his early years Thor had adventures on Earth, or Midgard as the Norse referred to it, and in Asgard and the other nine realms of Norse mythology. An early feature of the series was Tales of Asgard, where episodes of Norse mythology were re-enacted, sort of Marvel Comics meets Classics Illustrated. Eventually Thor spent most of his time in Asgard, his secret identity of Donald Blake going by the board, especially after Thor learned that he had always been Thor and that Odin had placed him on Midgard in the guise of Donald Blake in order to teach him humility. Thor was one of my favorite comic book series as I was growing up in the Sixties. I was fascinated by the Norse mythology background and I found the Thor stories to be more imaginative than the more prosaic and formulaic superhero adventures of most of the other comic book series. I also found the quasi-Shakespearean language in which Thor and the other Norse “gods” spoke to be a hoot!"

I really enjoyed the first book, just short of giving it 5 stars, which is still debatable because I really liked it!

I’m only a few chapters into it right now so I’m optimistic and interested to see where the story will take me from here!"

This RV park has a mixture of sites ranging from tents, to fifth wheels, to cabins to big rigs. On a short walk around the park I spotted the colony of tenters and there asleep in the front seat of one car that belonged to them was a young woman who apparently opted for the front seat of the vehicle in lieu of the ground. And of course they have stables for horses and room for horse trailers for those who tow their own. As soon as we arrived I could smell the horses; a horseman statue on top the roof welcomes arrivals."

"Thus, even in 2012, the Indian law is unclear on whether it should grant immunity to intermediaries for copyright infringement claims. This is in complete contradistinction to the position in the United States. The Second Circuit (which is an appellate court) left no ambiguities when it made clear that the DMCA safe harbour provisions would be available to Youtube for both direct infringement (also known as 'primary infringement') as well as secondary infringement. American law seems to be taking a more progressive approach, whilst trying to define the exact contours of such immunity. Why is this important? Because the Indian MySpace decision holds the intermediary liable for primary copyright infringement under S.51(a)(ii) of the Indian Copyright Act. This is something that needs to be made explicit in the next version of the Intermediary guidelines to clarify the Indian law or in its absence, the sitting judges should appreciate this point in their next ruling on this issue."

"3) The naturalistic theory of culture, then, insists that asking the question “nature or nurture” or “biology or culture” is the wrong question. Rather, we should be asking how our evolutionary biological form produced the cultural brain; how culture is an emergent property of brains in a society; that culture only exists in a body (culture is embodied) and could not exist without a body; that the beliefs, practices, and objects of any individual or group emerge over time in specific umbworlds; that the brain evolved to give a degree of agency over both the umbworld and its own consciousness to solve problems; and finally because culture is inextricably linked to the environment and because the environment is constantly changing, so is culture a necessarily emergent property of the brain, not a thing in itself."

"In 1965, two years after Jim assumed the leadership, Mayor Wagner chose not to run for reelection and John Lindsay, “fusion” candidate of the Republican and Liberal parties easily defeated Abe Beame of Brooklyn, the regular organization democratic candidate who was previously the City budget director and Comptroller under Wagner (before he turned on DeSapio). Lindsay, a graduate of Yale College and Yale Law School who was a partner in the white shoe law firm of Webster Sheffield, was a highly photogenic Kennedyesque candidate who promised to sweep away the corrupt old arrangements that had governed New York City in favor of new and modern management. He was strongly supported by the middle class including many liberal democrats and was the antithesis of Carmine DeSapio and the old Tammany Hall bosses. Certainly under the Lindsay administration there would be no role in or assistance from the City government for the McManus club that was an old line ally of Carmine DeSapio. Nevertheless, Jim McManus and the McManus Club carried on trying to help constituents, still providing a social function to the Irish and others of Hell’s Kitchen who attended his parties and sought his help, now largely with private contacts."

This eclectic imprint offers authors advances of no more than $100,000, but offsets 'the pain' by offering a much larger royalty. The imprint involves the author in the process of the book from production right through to hands-on marketing. Effectively, we are looking at a kind of partnership publishing. On the other side of the coin, we have subsidy publishers like Cold Tree Press who are now moving away from out and out subsidy publishing toward the traditional model of publishing. Troubador in England are another example. They operate a sister imprint called Matador, (run by Jeremy Thompson, one of the most successful self publishing authors in the last twenty years) who self/subsidy and partnership publish depending on their evaluation of a book. I believe long term success lies somewhere in between self/subsidy and partnership publishing, and several publishers are starting to see this, both in the UK and United States. I would be nice to believe that this change is driven by entrepreneurism and independence, but the reality is economics."

He just accepted that if he wanted a secure, comfortably well-off lifestyle with certain perks, then that’s what he had to do, that’s who he had to be, and he just got on with it and achieved his goals. He was a working man who liked going home at the end of the day; he lived in the one home on his Encino property for a third of his life. He liked stability, organisation and for things to be in order. After all, this was a man who had his suits hung in his closet not just ranked by color but by when they were purchased. He did not like chaos."

She’ll still be your friend, he says. Oh. Isn’t that precious. Isn’t she gracious. How the hell could anyone ever trust a thing she EVER says again?

"Second, and more importantly, the post seemed to have such a great sense of closure. Like the story had really seen its end.

It sounded as if my problems were over. The skeleton from the closet is finally dead and motionless, the monster is not as scary as he seemed, and the lions have been tamed.

Even where Paul says, “I will glory in my suffering,” the Greek is “I will rejoice.” This is a present imperative which means he calls us to habitual continual practice of rejoicing."

"Also, I've always been struck by the lesser-acknowledged element of sexual rebellion present in the feature film of CLOWNS. While much action is still phrased in neutral words to appease what's left of the Production Code, we are presented with a story where a child is openly acknowledged to have been conceived by a promiscuous mother (""[Nick's father] is not a where question, that's a who question."") and is well aware his guardian is prone to having booty calls (""Your 'work' left her gloves.""). When Murray and failed social worker Sandra Markowitz fall in love, there may be a partition around the bed when she spends the night, but sure as there's mustard on pastrami there ain't no wall of Jericho separating the two of them in that bed. For a movie that was being pitched to large family audiences, this was a pretty daring acknowledgement of the fact that ""family"" was beginning to be redefinied in society."

Give them a goblet of blood they'll drink it and never ask where it came from, but killing humans is, like, wrong, just like the 'good' Terminator can only shoot humans in the legs, and Batman even risks collateral lives to not run over the Joker on his gay little scooter (The Dark Knight)."

If they do, the only way the nursing home Medicaid applicant (or community spouse) will be allowed to receive Medicaid benefits is if they assign their support rights to the State of Illinois to allow the State to take legal action against the non-disclosing spouse, or, if they can prove that it is an undue hardship."

"Good news people! With the amount of vinyl rips that I occasionally provide here, one might think that I'm just an old fart living in the dinosaur ages but you'd be wrong. Vinyl record sales are back in high rotation. In 2010 Vinyl Records sales increased to become the fastest growing music format in USA and Canada. Take that digital. Also these numbers do not include all of the 100% DIY/Independent releases. Or sales from most Mom & Pop stores and bands who sell off-stage at concerts. Barcodeless-off-the-grid stuff. So the numbers are even higher than being reported. Now if you think it's just a bunch of us old hippies trying to relive our glory years you'd be wrong again. Younger people are the fastest growing market for vinyl. There are a number of factors at work here. Digital download limitations in recent months has led some customers toward searching out for higher sound quality, as well as the more authentic experience of physically putting on a record and holding and looking at the sleeve. After reading several articles I've come up with at least 10 reasons for the renewed interest in the glorious vinyl sound."

"What this shows is that YECs have a distorted view of the uniformitarian principle… It would be unfair to say that these criticisms of the principle would never have been true, since they would have been earlier when modern geology was coming around. What has to be mentioned is that before, geologists had practiced a variety of uniformity now called substantive uniformitarianism. Today, however, geologists have long rejected that version in favor of another called methodological uniformitarianism… The variety that YECs spend their time knocking down is the one no longer practiced. Today’s geology does not rule out the possibility of unusual events and massive disasters; in fact they fit in well with uniformity. Also, the idea that all rate accumulations must have been the same for all times in all cases is not a concept in uniformity either; the process in play may have existed, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they constantly happen with the same intensity."

"Effectively hamstrung by this defection, the remaining crew members, organized by their captain, set-off for the south and warmer climate, seeking to escape death at the hands of the encroaching winter. The vanir elected to stay with the ship, having made contact with the native sentient species; a humanoid race of ethereal beauty, the newcomers called them “alfar,” though they had no name for themselves. A telepathic race, they and the vanir shared an interest in the development of their psychic potential, and over the next many years would work together to create the seidhr crafts. They would also find that the two species were physically compatible with one another, and children born of both races soon appeared, further rooting the immigrants in their new world."

"The Kay Bob’s name is a play on kebabs. The meat line-up is kebab-esque in preparation and it’s a simple choice of seven combinations right now. Each sandwich is a puffy, white, flat bread wrap. The Tammie Rae brings ties together barbecue chicken, Cole slaw and melted Jack cheese. It’s straightforward and satisfying. The Uncle Bob is a burger wrapped up with lettuce, tomato and your choice of sauce. The horseradish sauce is a bit tame, but the quality of the local beef stands out with a pleasant sweetness. The sides include crispy and thick-cut sweet potato chips; a mellow and chilled black bean and corn salad; skinny hand-cut fries; and flavorful sweet sesame slaw with a crunch from Raman."

"I am a Midtown Atlanta resident. I am married and have lived in the Metro-Atlanta area since 1997. After living in suburbia - Alpharetta – for four years and a few months, we decided to sell the house and move to Midtown. We have lived in Midtown in a high-rise condominium since March of 2003. We enjoy cooking, theatre, museums, travel, visiting with friends, volunteering for various organizations/causes and good wine. Since moving to Midtown, I served as the on-site Community Association Manager for Metropolis Condominium Association and currently as the Community Association Manager for Colony House Condominium Association. During my down time one might find me reading a book, listening to various genres of music, editing photos on the Mac, playing video games or sitting on our balcony enjoying the view of Piedmont Park, Midtown and Downtown Atlanta. I am a member of the Midtown Neighbor’s Association (MNA), participated on the MNA Land Use Committee, Midtown Alliance Residential Council and attend various other civic/community organization meetings/events of interest. I also organized a group of 20 Midtown residential property managers who meet on a regular basis to socialize, network and share best practices/ideas related to living in-town and in multi-unit residential communities. I received the PCAM® designation, the highest designation available from Community Association Institute (CAI) which requires strict adherence to the CAI Code of Ethics and annual continuing education requirements. I hold a Community Association Manager License from the Georgia Real Estate Commission and have also earned the Association Management Specialist (AMS®) designation from CAI. I am also designated as a Certified Manager of Community Associations (CMCA®) by the National Board of Certification for Community Association Managers. I currently serve on the CAI-GA Chapter Program Committee and Legislative Action Committee. I was previously involved in the hospitality industry as General Manager and eventually as a Director of Operation for a portfolio of hotels. As General Manager, I received many company and brand awards, most notably one of my properties received the Connie Award. This award, presented by Hilton Hotels, recognizes only the top 5% of Hilton branded hotels worldwide for customer satisfaction and successful achievement of brand initiatives."

The steak was TINY, the potatoes were cold, the gravy was congealed. Basically, an ugly mess. If I had paid the $32 they charged for the meal, I would have made the chef redo it. I just picked at the potatoes. So I had two minuscule pieces of meat for dinner. Yeah, don't expect to see us going back there anytime soon.

This was an outrageous work, providing that it explicitly stated that the Earth is not in the centre of the Universe (or even our solar system, as a matter of fact), which cannot possibly be true. I mean, if you ask me, you have to be crazy to believe something like that. The Earth no longer being in the centre of the Universe? It can't be. We're special! God loves us (and by ""us"" I mean all the white christians, and only them).

"This is brilliant. You don't even have to know what he's ranting about to enjoy. But, just for some background: Kevin Rudd (the former, now knifed PM of Australia) and his side-kick Treasurer Wayne Swan, decided that they would start taxing the successful Australian mining sector to squeeze money so they could waste even more on their pet Union projects. The big mining companies didn't like this idea (who would?) and started an advertising campaign against the government, which affected their poll numbers in the negative. It has now been revealed that Twiggy Forrest, an Australian mining boss, made a deal with Kevin Rudd behind closed doors to support the tax so that the heat on the government could cool. However, Mr Swan decided that Rudd had to go - even though Swan was the one who pushed for the mining tax - and ganged up with Gillard to dispose of Rudd. Once Rudd was gone, Swan and Gillard made a deal with the 3 huge non-Australian owned mining companies - no details have been released about what they got from the government to stop their advertising blitz - and cut Twiggy out of the deal. Joe Hildebrand - a conservative journalist - knew about the Twiggy deal with Kevin Rudd 3 years ago and reported on it back then, but no one took notice. Now that more details have emerged about the knifing of not only Rudd but Twiggy as well, and now that the major Australian newspapers have sat up and noticed, has this whole sordid affair been reported on. It just goes to show how devious the ruling Labor Party is. They have a long track-record of broken promises and doing grubby deals. They want the pie and to eat it too. We the tax payer will be paying off their debt for a long time. We had $0 deficit under John Howard and then Kevin Rudd and his merry bandits were elected into office at the end of 2007, and they have racked up debt to the tune of over $230 BILLION in just 4 short years. And what have we got to show for it apart from some school halls, cashed up Unions, and burnt houses from their disastrous Pink Batt roof insulation scheme? NOTHING!"

"The new noninvasive imaging techniques that allow us to “see” how the brain operates have been a boon to the study of cognition. Through this medium, we now know that the brain is capable of “rewiring” itself. In doing so, the brain can regain some of the cognitive abilities previously diminished as a result of damage from alcohol or other diseases. The brain’s remarkable ability to recover is important for at least two reasons. First, alcohol use over a period of time, even at low levels of drinking, can produce varying degrees of cognitive damage, a problem that is of particular concern because alcohol use is so widespread. Thus, the brain’s self-repairing ability may help defer or reduce alcohol-induced cognitive problems among a large portion of the population. Second, the brain’s ability to rewire itself may have implications in terms of adolescent drinking. Recent evidence suggests that the adolescent brain, which is still forming important cellular connections, is more vulnerable than the adult brain to alcohol-induced damage. This is particularly troubling, given the problems associated with chronic binge drinking, which is all too common among young people. The brain’s ability to rewire important neurological systems might help mitigate a lifetime of cognitive difficulties resulting from chronic drinking during adolescence, but we do not yet know if this is true. Future research will help clarify this and other important questions about alcohol’s effect on cognition."

"This is a hard novel to write a review for, as I’m sure other readers have experienced, without spoiling it for those of you who haven’t read it. It is a very complex novel full of twists and turns that constantly keep you second guessing on which characters you can trust and which ones you can’t. Adam Christopher’s characters are really the strength of the novel, I believe. Rad’s character feels very Chandler-esque and just your average Joe. He wants to do what’s right, not just for himself but for everyone else who lives in Empire State. And boy, does he face some challenges along the way! With the suspicions surrounding his best pal Kane, and the enigmatic explorer Captain Carson and his robotic companion, Byron, Rad knows he can only really trust himself. But how can one man save an entire world?"
"Although he proved to be durable through the last three years for N.C.

We quite happily had a few great pints of Fyne Ales Jarl, Stewart Forth Mist and Knops California Common (quite caramely today) watching the game come to life in the last 30 minutes - can't really ask for much better than that - except for the result to be different I guess!"
"1. …The title is, “Praise, to David himself.” Praise to Christ Himself. And since He is called David, who came to us of the seed of David, yet He was our King, ruling us, and bringing us into His kingdom, therefore “Praise to David himself” is understood to mean, Praise to Christ Himself. Christ according to the flesh is David, because He is the Son of David: but according to His Divine Nature He is the Creator of David, and Lord of David. “I will exalt Thee, my God, my King; and I will bless Thy Name for the age, and age upon age” (ver. 1). Ye see that the praise of God is here begun, and this praise is carried on even to the end of the Psalm. …Now then begin to praise, if thou intendest to praise for ever. He who will not praise in this transitory “age,” will be silent when “age upon age” has come. But lest any one should in any otherwise also understand what he saith, “I will praise Thy Name for the age,” and should seek another age, wherein to praise, he saith, “Every day will I bless Thee” (ver. 2). Praise then and bless the Lord thy God every day, that when single days have passed, and there has come one day without end, thou mayest go from praise to praise, as “from strength to strength.” No day shall pass by, wherein I bless Thee not. And it is no wonder, if in thy day of joy thou bless the Lord. What if perchance some day of sorrow hath dawned on thee, as is natural in the circumstances of our mortal nature, as there is abundance of offences, as temptations are multiplied; what, if something sad befall thee, a man; wilt thou cease to praise God? wilt thou cease to bless thy Creator? If thou cease, thou hast lied in saying, “every day,” etc. But if thou cease not, although it scent to thee to be ill with thee in the day of thy sorrow, yet in thy God it shall be well with thee. …"

"If the cars show the speed expressed in MB/s we don't need any calculation. However we have to pay attention to this datas, the reported are the maximum speeds that are declared by the manufacturer and verified in a not so impartial way. Often on the package or on the card the manufacturer, to avoid customer's complaints, place an ""up to"" before the speed, ore you can even notice the presence of an asterisk that point that the expressed speed is the maximum."

As I was tempest tossed in the recurring crescendos of sweet anguish my mind went back into the haze of euphoria.

I was immobilized by the rising and falling tide of orgasmic pleasure and I became one with that pleasure."

"In Title III, the House Bill sets up the National Health Insurance Exchange. And as people like Ezra Klein have been saying for months, access to the Exchange is critical, because it sets the limit for how many people will have a choice to choose the Public Option. Under the House’s version, the Exchange starts small in the first year of operation (2013), including only firms that employ 25 people or less, and people who don’t get employer-based health care even after the mandate – which includes (explicitly) the self-employed, less than full time workers (an important group to add, given the fact that they tend coverage even when their employers offer health care to their workforces), and the like. In year two, this expands to firms that employ 50 people or less, and in year three, all firms with 100 or less. Importantly, the Insurance Commissioner can give firms with 100 members of more a waiver to get onto the Exchange – which means, among other things, that it is imperative that Commissioner be appointed by a Democratic administration in 2013."

"The Unremembered is Peter Orullian's debut novel although he has published a few short stories in various anthologies the last few years. The series is named The Vault of Heaven, which brings a lot of things to mind. Definitely something on an Epic scale. The Unremembered will be released in April 2011. I know that is a long time, but it certainly could be a strong Epic Fantasy debut. Next year is ramping up to be one of the most competitive years for Fantasy with new books by Abercrombie, Rothfuss, Lynch, Morgan, Abraham, and Grossman. There are also sequels to a number of my 2010 debut favorites coming out, but I always like to make time for debut authors so I'll definitely be one of the first in line to check out The Unremembered. Here is the description to taunt you with:"

If Abby loses, she must live in Travis' apartment for the same amount of time. Either way, Travis has no idea that he has finally met his match."

"Prior to this, the notion of platform building confused and concerned me to the point of taking up much more of my available ‘thinking space’ than the writing of my novel. A comment was made on the blog post that if Tolkien had lived in todays world and been pre-occupied with social media we might never have been given The Lord of the Rings. While I don’t for one second believe I’m in the same galaxy as Mr Tolkien, I believe the point is relevant to all of us. In a fast-paced world where most of us within the ‘aspiring author’ category have to squeeze writing our novels into what little spare time we have in our day, shouldn’t we be focusing almost exclusively on improving the quality of our work than the quality of our social media platform?"

"Teddy Long is being harassed by William Regal, which is hilarious. He then is being harassed by Aksana, who is with another new Wrestler, his name is Antonio Cesaro, who is the former Claudio Castagnoli. Of course, since Teddy is acting like an officer guard, he doesn’t say a word, and Aksana makes fun of him for not being the boss anymore, so Johnny invites them both into his office to discuss the details of a contract."

When walking past the rotisserie chickens I thought about the hormones injected in them and the overcrowded cages they live in and how their beaks are cut off."

"When Olivia gets older say 4 or 5 I am hoping she is going to want to fly kites with me but at that age she will not quite be ready for stunt kites so a single line kite will be more in line for her to start off with. Fortunately Prism, my favorite kite company, also has a product line of single line kites too. Some of these kites are designed so that they can be easily stowed away in a book bag, luggage, car or wherever. Their newest addition to this stowaway single line kite design is the Delta Kite.

That $20 price is great and lucky for Olivia and I the $20 one is in the Spectrum color scheme just like my new Quantum Stunt kite. So it didn't take much convincing myself to use bit more of my birthday money to go ahead and buy Olivia one of the new Prism Delta Stowaway kites in the Spectrum color scheme. In the meantime until Olivia is old enough to fly it herself I will now have 3 Prism Stowaway kites in my quiver, 2 Diamond and 1 Delta design, which is a perfect number to match the number of cars we have in our family. So no matter what vehicle I am driving, if I am out and I get somewhere with some good wind and open land I will always have a kite on hand to fly."

"On the up side, the Sun Up brew pub/restaurant was hopping when I dropped in around 1:00 PM to get the growler topped off. There was easy, casual banter going on between the wait staff and the clientele seated at the bar and the bar tendress indicated they were nearly out of the Nut Before Christmas Nut Brown, so I can only gather that business is good. Will I be back? Hell yes, I’ll be back! Who wouldn’t buy beer from a brewer named Uwe? (I went to high school with a dude named Uwe. You think? Nah.) Listen; if I was looking for Big Mac consistency, I’d be buying the Miller/Coors/Bud products more often. You buy a seasonal beer from a craft brewer and you take your chance, right?"
"I also saw the California premiere of Silver Bullets, one of the half-dozen features the prolific young director Joe Swanberg has completed since his third one Hannah Takes The Stairs played here nearly four years ago. If Silver Bullets (my own first encounter with his directing work) is at all typical, I can understand why he polarizes audiences (and perhaps programmers as well); though there's evidence of conceptual brilliance, it's overshadowed by a half-heartedness of execution that asserts itself as a visual style. Or perhaps in place of one."

"What makes me a little sad today is that this morning, I was totally not present at all during our morning routine. I was thinking about how much work I had to get done, my projects, my new camera lens, Colden's birthday this weekend, the bills...and before I knew it, Opa was here and it was time to get Colden dressed and out the door."
"But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one."
"I think that now there seems to be coming plenty of bands who have jumped the wagon so to speak and I think it’s sad to see that. Most labels today have not got a feeling for quality music thus flooding the market with low quality bands. I guess they just see the opportunity to cash in – and since they won’t do that they will drop the poor bands after one album. Nothing bad spoken about these bands, I think it’s great that this type of music get’s the attention it needs – but bands get signed too early on before having had the time to grow together as a band and get their own identity, and the people who actually buy their records are no fools, let’s not underestimate the listener. Therefore they will not buy the records, the labels lose money and people get fed up wasting cash on bands that are not good enough. When this cycle has reached its peak interest in this genre will fade away, except for a few devoted music fans, and the focus will move on the “next big thing/genre”. It is very fashionable right now to play this type of music, and even though we haven’t really released anything yet we have always loved and played this music to some extent. For us, we are not interested in being part of this hype attention that is happening now (although it helps of course let’s not deny that) and I honestly believe that we have a different approach to it as well. At least a few of us in the band are rabid vinyl collectors and love a lot of bands that probably no-one has ever heard of as well as listening to all different kinds of music. A good song is a good song – no matter what genre. This gives us something of a different background, as opposed to only listening to Black Sabbath and Pentagram then thinking “Hey let’s start a 70′s heavy rock band with occult leanings!”"
"In truth, it was about the size of my thumb. But when you see something so wonderful and so unexpected, its presence distorts and focuses your perception.

"How much does your life weigh? Imagine for a second that you’re carrying a backpack. I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life… you start with the little things. The shelves, the drawers, the knickknacks, then you start adding larger stuff. Clothes, tabletop appliances, lamps, your TV… the backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. You go bigger. Your couch, your car, your home… I want you to stuff it all into that backpack. Now I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends, folks around the office… and then you move into the people you trust with your most intimate secrets. Your brothers, your sisters, your children, your parents and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend, your girlfriend. You get them into that backpack, feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake your relationships are the heaviest components in your life. All those negotiations and arguments and secrets, the compromises. The slower we move the faster we die. Make no mistake, moving is living. Some animals were meant to carry each other to live symbiotically over a lifetime. Star crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not swans. We are sharks."

What you do not know is that immediately following your appointment they are meeting with someone from your largest competitor.

I will outline both meetings and then we will break down their use of the principles and their effectiveness."
"(Moving down seven spots) 10.) Gargoyles (Season 2, Vol. 2 and Season 3) – In 1994, the syndicated block of Disney animated shows known as “The Disney Afternoon” debuted a little known show entitled Gargoyles. It has gone on to be one of the biggest Disney cartoon shows ever produced with a fan base to rival most other fantasy/ sci fi shows. Disney released a few episodes on VHS back in the 90′s and then started releasing the full show in 2005, stopping at the first half of the second season. The second half of season two and The Goliath Chronicles, known by some simply as season three, have yet to be released despite the great demand for this show."

"But disappointing in the background to the question was the revelation that same day about AMC Akers replying to a member of the public that her remit was indeed limited. This unfortunately confirms what a Met source told me last Monday: that a few career warning shots have been fired across Sue’s bows by the uniformed dissemblers around her. I have now heard from three separate sources that, to date, no police enquiry has nailed a senior member of Newscorp management; and thus I am left hoping that the failure is genuine rather than the result of others’ encouraging her to fail."
"Such belief is amusing considering that as many as five heads of John the Baptist floated around Europe.

The comments that you have left on my recent posts, I've read over and over again. They have given me strength and the love that I was so thirsty of during some of my lowest points. Your tweets made me smile even at times when I felt that the last thing I wanted to do was smile. The outpouring of emails and direct messages I had received from some of you, offering me shoulders to cry on, listening ears, precious times out of your busy schedules to let me know that you cared. Even when I had been quite MIA lately, many of you continued to pay me a visit through my blog just to check on how I was doing."

Almost immediately, Bernie decides to finally break into the big time by taking Matilda and her trainer Baker (Clive Revill) back to The States and having this Marsupial Mauler fight a few rounds against a human. Of course, Bernie has to deal with a protective animal rights activist named Karen (Karen Carlson), boxing commissioner Wildman (Roy Clark), world-weary sports columnist Parkhurst (Robert Mitchum), a well-connected hood named Uncle Nono (Harry Guardino) and the current boxing champ of the world, Dockerty (Larry Pennell)."

Plus, I don't have the pressures of group dinner dynamics at play. The Chads of the world can go f**k themselves."

"So… I’ve asked peoples advice on how to fix my insatiable appetite. I know for a fact that its sometimes just mental too… probably a desire to eat because I pretty much denied myself in the first couple months of the year.. and while I could because of how controlled the situation was… now its different. But anyway… some people have suggested filling up on tons of water. Well.. yes, completely agree there. However. I can’t. Unless I start filling up on water as soon as I get home around 4:30… btu at that point I’ve already put away most of my calories for the day. Some people have said well up your protein. My protein intake is adequate, usually more than my recommended amount (as shown to me on myfitnesspal)."

"Part of it has to do with our culture. Culturally, we’ve slipped over the precipice of “tolerance” to such a degree that people aren’t willing to say that much of anything is “wrong” or “right.” Adultery has become an “affair.” Sin has become “mistakes.” We’ve gutted our thinking of any real conviction, any lasting moral foundation.

The Toro from Spain was heavenly; the chunky cut giving it a real meaty quality when bit into. The Uni from Santa Barbera was nice and sweet but a touch over-powering on the finish. On the other hand, the Kampachi (yellowtail) from Japan was outstanding, creamier than any I’ve tasted, no doubt as a result of the way it was cut (with thin lines through it, not unlike how squid sashimi is usually prepared)."

"Long lines, overwhelming crowds, whiny adults and kids, and less than a minute of joy sounds more like a trip to Disneyland than the inaugural 626 Asian Night Market. Situated in Pasadena, an area that borders many cities with largely Asian, predominately Chinese, immigrant demographic familiar with the night market traditions of Asia, this highly anticipated event sounds like it was doomed from the start. The founders of the night market advertised in several global and local newspapers, and some of the places Asians spend most of their time hanging out these days: Youtube & Facebook. Then, these disgruntled Asians that attended the night market went on Yelp.com, another favorite hangout spot (we Asians love judging things don’t we? is it the inner “tiger-mom” in us?) among Asians, to complain, not so much about the food quality, but rather the horrendous wait times for food and the imminent danger of getting trampled by their fellow Asians in hot pursuit of Taiwanese street snacks. This sounds more like the running of the bulls than a food festival. You would think the organizers, Taiwanese immigrants themselves, would have know that a lot of Chinese people love settling in the places like Southern California because they can get all the foods they love from their homelands BUT with American suburban conveniences of safety (so they think) and TONS of space and sprawl to get away from noisy urban centers. HELLO, look no further than the suburban architecture of Asian monster homes with its unnecessary interior spaces (who needs three dens?) and the lack furniture and decorations to even cover that much space as proof of how much Asians love U.S. ‘burbs!"

"1) Friends: Not everyone in your life is a friend. A friend is someone you can trust. If you cannot trust someone to a certain degree, they are not your friend. You share something with someone and they broadcast your story repeatedly. That is not a friend. A friend will tell you the truth, a friend will encourage you but will not be afraid to give you a reality check. A relationship based on externals and superficial things is not a real friendship. Some people have no friends, all they have are acquaintances and hangers-on, people who want something from them. A friend will love you, recognize your imperfections, and still stand by you. Friends uplift you, they do not pull you down.True friends are hard to find."

"Now imagine your life without them. This is exactly why we are so careful to love. Because when we love a person, we put ourselves at risk of getting hurt. We are desperately afraid of loving each other and we hold ourselves back, because we know that as soon as we give in, there is the potential for suffering. It is a natural inclination for us to avoid injury, both physically and emotionally. Studies show that when people suffer a loss, or when a couple ends a relationship, their bodies undergo the same physical reactions as an addict going through withdrawal. It is biology’s way of telling us “human relationships are important too. Be careful.” The argument could be made that it is self-preservation that keeps us from loving freely."

When you play through annotated games, and the annotator says “obviously such-and-such a move would be bad because of such-and-such a positional factor”, you’ll see the truth in that assessment. I think Silman put it best in his review of de la Maza’s book:"

But I can remember picking off and eating the ‘crisp’ part off of a rhubarb crisp and leaving the pink part behind thinking the rhubarb was too tart. But in the past ten years or so I can’t get enough of it! So even though I halved the shortbread recipe, I still made the full recipe of jam so that we’d have some leftover for the week:)"

"The picture at the left shows the initial pattern that was created in Photoshop with the brush and custom shape tools on a white background. Notice that none of the icons are cut off but are within the boundaries of the sides. This is to avoid imperfect repeating when the pattern is tiled. As was stated above, the background could have been transparent when the pattern was created so that it could have been placed on any color background. The repeated pattern in the example was created with the Pattern Overlay and was scaled down to about 20% while in the Pattern Overlay window."

"The issue around Afrikaans was a handy stick which the communist propagandists used. They played with the lives and the future of the black students, and today there is a whole generation of blacks who never finished their schooling because they were being used as pawns by the communists. Go to any communist take-over in history and you will see that the one thing a communist regime does not tolerate, is educated people. That is the privilege of the elite."

"I did manage to get other things done today, such as removing the last of the outdoor Christmas decorations that don’t involve climbing up onto the roof. Also I went to my kids music lessons. normally I sit outside for the half hour, but today my son’s piano teacher asked me to come in. I might want to regret the lost writing time, but it would only have netted me an extra three or four pages and that wouldn’t have been enough to make a difference."
"Please don’t misunderstand me… I LOVE cuddles. But when it comes to sleep time, I can’t sleep with someone touching me. (Can someone please explain to me why “Health,” “Sleep Disorders,” and “Conditions and Diseases” just appeared as “recommended tags” for this post…. Is not wanting cuddles a disease!?). I’m more than happy to cuddle a guy if I’m watching a movie, or when we are in bed talking pre or post sex… But once it’s sleep time, just stop touching me."

The brewery named on the back is stated as 'Kiuchi Brewery' so I'm not sure where the Hitachino Nest comes into it really. I think we'll start with the most obvious point first: The two beers I'm reviewing from Kiuchi tonight are some of the finest looking beers I've ever seen - the branding is excellent and quite frankly, puts hundreds of other beers to shame."
"My kids (9 and 12) loved this book. Spinelli has a poetic, jazzy kind of voice. His word combinations are surprising and refreshing—definitely a fun-to-read-aloud kind of book. In our home, this brought up a lot of discussion about segregation and racism. We had read William Armstrong's Sounder and Mildred Taylor's Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry recently. Maniac Magee brought the problem of racial tension into the middle part of the century. (The time period isn't named, but I'd put this in the 1950s-70s.) I highly recommend it not only to help understand the ignorance that perpetuates stereotypes, but as a fun read. My nine-year-old wanted to read it again right away."

"Buying a house together has definitely been a learning experience. One thing I learned about the boyfriend is that he needs to write things down and make lists in order to get things done. For example, he has to sit down with a spread sheet and go over every expense/savings in order to determine how much he has left over at the end of the month. I handle these things a little bit differently. I like to pay for what needs to be paid for and whatever is left over I either put some into savings or spend. Simple. Easy. And no complicated spread sheets required. Part of my mentality comes from the fact that I have lived on my own before and have had bills to pay since I was old enough to open my own bank account."

"IN THE PRESENT TENSE, YOU MUST KNOW AND INCLUDE EVERY TINY DETAIL--there is no room for skipping forward. By placing the narrative in the immediate present, you're investing every moment and every breath with importance. Using past tense allows us to glibly skip forward and cut out of scenes easily once they have been milked for their interest. But in the present tense, you've already chosen the importance of, well, the present, which makes it much more difficult to escape artfully from the many boredoms that pad the interesting parts of our day-to-day life. This means that unless you are very, very skillful indeed, the format of your narrative may force you to include content that bores your audience, either directly or gradually."
"You could see them if you craned your neck in one of the bedrooms, but you got the best view if you stood on the toilet in the little bathroom at the end of the hallway.

"“I have to adjust to the different soccer landscape in this country, adjust to the fact that 75 to 80 percent of the players are overseas, some in Mexico, so they’re all over the place. They come in from all different backgrounds, so that’s a bit of a different challenge. I just take things the way they are, and then I look for solutions and I look for ways to communicate with them in their own ways. Maybe I have to adjust and use Twitter and Facebook to get hooked to them and get a message out to them, which I hadn’t done before. So as a coach, it’s important that you kind of analyze your environment and say OK, based on what you’ve seen now, this is what you have to do and you have to change the way of doing things. It’s important to get the messages out to the players and that they understand why we do certain things, why we want to encourage them to look at things a little bit different. Every one of them has lived their daily lives in a very different way, and so we have to figure out how we get things across to them and hopefully make them step-by-step a little bit better in everything that they’re doing.”"

"Hey, it's another unnecessary boondoggle pushed for by Bloomberg and the EDC! You know what that means. Actually, this one is wasting time and money because Jerrold Nadler accepted tens of thousands of dollars from lobbyists for the railroad industry and because it benefits the communities he represents in Manhattan. Maybe the talking heads who are so concerned about the effects of increasing truck traffic - which their own study says will increase even more WITH the tunnel - can explain how we're going to pay for this when we have no money for any other rail project in the foreseeable future."
"So tonight I got on Kate DiCamillo's website and clicked around. N is the kind of girl who knows I'll be on duty again tomorrow and will come wanting to know if I have anything new to share with her. The best thing I found, though, was a list of tips for writers that Kate has on her website. It made me think of N, and somehow, I have an easy time imagining her growing up to be the kind of writer whose books make young readers cry their eyes out and come back for more."

"Ahh the French, how we love to love and hate the French. France is the worlds biggest tourist destination. Given this detail you might have thought that the majority of people who work in the massive service industry might bother to learn a smattering of the first or second language of all their millions of visitors, you know, English. Not a bit of it. Go into any bar or restaurant and ask “Parlez-vous anglais?” You will get a shake of the head and a “non”. You might ask “why should they, its their country”? And you have a point. But If I was working in an industry catering to the largest tourist numbers in the world it would not be rocket science to me to at least try to learn the english for the stuff on the menu. You know, just to be a bit helpful to the people responsible for my wages being paid. This escapes most French waiting staff. France is effectively a nation with many nice towns and villages full of splendid places to eat and drink. Eating and drinking are the best things about France."

"I went to the ENT because I have this weird ear thing where my ear pops open and I can hear myself talking inside my head. I can hear my breathing, my heartbeat, my footfalls. According to the world wide web it's called Patulous Eustachian Tube, and it's rare and it's barely fixable. Hooray! It doesn't hurt but it's annoying as hell and makes me want to lie down, because when I do it stops. Or when I bend over. It doesn't happen all the time but when it does, oy. Unfortunately losing weight and exercising are prone to worsening symptoms but hell no, I won't sit around and gain weight. Anyway, PET is one of the few things Primal can't fix. In fact, since losing weight and exercising more (and by exercising more I mean walking barefoot around my neighborhood until I grow the balls and the funds to try this), it's been worse. What a buzz-kill. Actually, wait. Scratch the exercising more thing. I am not even exercising more. I am exercising less. But I am moving around more and I am sitting less."
"Normally, the these reproductions pieces exercises might be put into 5 levels:"
"""The words the book and films share are these: `You must pay for everything in this world one way and another. There is nothing free with the exception of God’s grace.' These two sentences suggest a world in which everything comes around, if not sooner then later. The accounting is strict; nothing is free, except the grace of God. But free can bear two readings — distributed freely, just come and pick it up; or distributed in a way that exhibits no discernible pattern. In one reading grace is given to anyone and everyone; in the other it is given only to those whom God chooses for reasons that remain mysterious."
"Social media conditions the mainstream media, as do bloggers. The blogger has become the journalist's friend - as shown by the Guardian's latest advert for its 'open journalism' project; see the picture accompanying this blog post - and there are numerous stories that take events in social media as their main point of reference each week all around the world. What is happening is that the mainstream media is adjusting its focus to accommodate these new players in the public sphere. When a tweeter can be sued by an editor for accurately conveying what a citizen journalist recorded during a public forum, the game has changed forever. And Zivkovic is right to applaud the growing number of scientists who are occupying a place in the communication chain. Zivkovic calls himself a ""science writer"" despite, he says, ""never going to j-school"". He writes on blogs."

"As I’ve discussed before, a major reason for this stalemate is ultimately due to how people think about public policy. In reality, neither progressive or conservative ideologies are hegemonic within the American electorate. Instead, public opinion is very much a mix of contradictory and paradoxical tendencies – we want to spend more money on the poor, but are opposed to welfare; we think foreign aid should be cut to a level that’s several times larger than current spending."

"And a second entry for ""the good"": last night's dinner. How many of you were readers of the late, lamented Gourmet Magazine? My guess is most of you. It kills me that when I sold my house in 2008 to move in with my now-husband, I recycled almost a hundred issues of Gourmet because I didn't want to move them. I figured that there were plenty more issues to come, right? A year later Gourmet stopped publication."

"The Doctor, Jamie and Carstairs try to make their escape in a SIDRAT but the dematerialisation is stopped from outside by the War Chief, who activates the dimensional controls, forcing the inside of the ship to shrink, much like what the Doctor did to the Monk's TARDIS in The Time Meddler. The Doctor emerges from the ship, apparently defeated, but quickly uses a gas valve to deal with his enemies, restores the ship's dimensional interior, locks the controls and departs for the war zone. They cross back to the 1917 zone but are recaptured by Smythe, who decides to kill the Doctor regardless of what his War Lord superiors may want. The Doctor is saved from the firing squad at the last minute once more; this time by the resistance, and Russell kills Smythe. There is a certainly a fair amount of repetition in this story but this works to show the futility and repetitiveness of War."

For a mere $9.75, you will be served an entire platter of food that even three hungry eaters - my BFF Wendy, her sister Cheryl who was visiting from New York, and I - couldn't finish. Not that we didn't try valiantly! It's just that the portion was so generous that, despite being ravenous because we didn't manage to find our way to dinner until after 9 o'clock on our Girls' Night Out, we still couldn't eat the entire dish."

Pile the stuff up til it’s really thick. This will keep moisture and nutrients in the tree’s roots. Putting large stones around a tree trunk or raising the soil to build a little circular wall will also do this to some extent. Mulch in your garden beds for the same purpose. Just make sure your plants there are big enough so as not to get suffocated!"

"We come now to encounters and combat, perhaps the most complex aspect of the whole game rules-wise, albeit in relative terms. This section of the pdf covers initial situation and the various reactions, and has an optional less random system for initiative which mixes things up a little. Certain details, like movement rates, may leave some scratching their heads, but the short section on adventuring at the end of the file, or a careful re-read, should hold the answers. Also, while the section covers additional aspects of combat fully, including fumbling or jamming, critical hits and the potential for instant death, there's no clear overview, so if you are new to this kind of game, I suggest reading through it all before attempting to understand any one element."

When he shows up, you just crossed a line too far and you are going to pay dearly for it."

"The first time he met me he had patted me on the butt; I screamed back at him. For you see, I was one of the first babies Dr. Scholl delivered when he started his medical practice. I almost worshipped the man. In those days doctors were held in very high esteem by their patients, practically thought of as gods, ones who could do not wrong. Today it is a bit different the way we think of doctors. With Martin, Allen and Freddie, Dr. Scholl came to Mussie's to see Mom. They were all three born at home. I can remember being just thrilled when seeing Dr. Scholl walk into the yard. Little kids have deep impressions about common everyday experiences. I was no different. He was my idol."

"On the other hand, Szereto worked to keep the individual characterizations close to the original, while neglecting to keep the dynamics between her more sexual versions consistent. Unfortunately, this lack of proportion keeps this work from really coming into its own. For example, while certain characters like Lydia have canon traits that make her a much easier target for additional raunchiness, capitalizing on that while keeping Lizzie’s original modesty strong enough that it often affects her enjoyment of her pleasures creates an extreme distance between the two sisters’ behavior that goes much further than the book. The result is that while the individual story lines keep a ring of validity, whenever they intersect things cease to make sense. Since a main plot point in any Pride & Prejudice adaptation hinges on Lydia performing an indiscretion that disgraces her entire family, it is necessary to keep her prior behavior within society’s expectations, if just barely. To keep society’s expectations, Lizzie’s expectations, so much more conservative than Lydia’s behavior for the majority of the book makes her “disgracing” action with Mr. Wickham insufficient for the effect it needs to have on the plot."
"Caroline Skinner, executive producer of Doctor Who, looked forward to the return of Script to Screen and commented, 'It's so exciting to be able to challenge young writers in this way. Doctor Who is such an amazing show to work on.

"Embarrassed, she took a step back and hurriedly gathered her things. Increasingly aware of what could have happened she asked Richie not to tell Laila anything. A couple of minutes later Raina was rushing down the stairs and rushing to the station, not sure where to go. She couldn’t go home stinking of weed and drunk, her mother was sharp and she’d be in more trouble than she was in the mood for – so she just sat on the train glad she didn’t do anything stupid with Richie."

Producers can then be the hero and help make them their realities. These tools can help the industry achieve another goal: reaching the middle market. It’s no secret that companies and producers have been aiming for the big cases to the point where the number of policies plummeted over the past few decades, even while the overall policy value has increased."

"There I was ruminating over the Illustration Friday theme - dusty. I just didn't know what to do with myself. My mind wandered into old book shops with wizened old men sitting on stools in the corner surrounded by piles of dusty volumes... I dreamt of vintage bottles of vin rouge gathering a murky outside coating in the cellars of French Chateaux. I even contemplated sketching something in the dust on the TV. Until, at last the Muse rapped on the back of my eyelids then started singing something into the windmills of my mind. I think she was rather wishin and a hopin that I'd listen. She knows I'll try anything and, given that my weekly Sunday Sketch is beginning to have a theme of boundary pushing, then an attempt at an accurate portrait seemed perfect."

Wisconsin is #3 overall in the Pomeroy ratings, sport the nations lowest Turnover%, the nation's best EffectiveFG% defense, and #2 overall Adjusted Defensive Efficiency. The Gators are rated #13 overall with the #1 offense. For now, those two get the benefit of the doubt...for now. Wiscy will have to turn around that conference record and Florida will have to win a lot of SEC games. And, I expect both will do that...for now."

"The beers from Camden are good. The Hells Lager (apparently a stab at combining the helles and pils styles) works well, being a well-made lagery sort of a lager - clean, crisp and moreish. This is the beer you get if you go into a bar and ask for ""a beer"" - well-executed, transparently flawless, drinkable, bittersweet. The unfiltered version ups the ante a bit further, and the Unfiltered USA Hells slams down a hand of four aces and scoops the pot into its lap - zesty, slightly yeasty, but carrying that unmistakable hoppity-skippity of an unfiltered lager. It's just more alive, somehow."

They hope that youth group is a place where the young Christians can find acceptance with their peers."

And this harmless little occupation kept us going during the 8 hours that we sat around the airport, waiting for our plane to be signed as 'safe' after engine work. Eye Spy soon petered out. Not a problem- we devised secret codes for when we saw a 'Typical Brit Abroad', or someone who looked like they had a name beginning with a particular given letter. We wondered what the people in the MacDonalds queue would order, and we took great delight in observing what fashionable people were wearing. We saw a lot of young ladies with high buns, so obviously we had to discreetly hum the Bod tune to each other to sound the alert..."

"Furthermore, Alexandria was important to the cultus of Antinous. Hadrian and Antinous spent a great deal of time there in the year before Antinous’ death, and Hadrian returned there for an extended period after Antinous’ death. It is almost certain that there was a temple of some sort to Antinous in Alexandria. Hadrian’s influence on the city is also very marked. The coin of Antinous showing him as Antinous-Hermes on horseback on the reverse is an Alexandrian issue. Dionysius of Alexandria alluded to Antinous in his poem Periegete by calling him, in an acrostic, “the God Hermes under Hadrian.” So, Antinous’ connection to Alexandria is amply attested, and thus all the more relevant to a Roman-period festival of Alexandria’s foundation being observed in relation to him."

"From the O’Brien family we see how grace and human nature play out. Jack’s childhood in Waco, Texas, begins in innocence. With a capable father (Brad Pitt) and an almost angelic mother (Jessica Chastain) who is loving, nurturing, grace manifest, young Jack’s (Hunter McCracken) early days are blissful. Two younger brothers later, the siblings form a close bond. But as the boys grow older, the father becomes stern and strict, callous with his sons, demanding total obedience, expecting love where the seeds of fear are sown. From this character, we see human nature manifest in its destructive, self-seeking mode."

"I believe, on the one hand, that the emergency power of the President had ceased not in May 1946, when Congress held its regular sessions, as Mr. Justice Tuason and Mr. Justice Feria maintain, but on June 9, 1945, when Congress convened in a special session to consider general legislation. The emergency contemplated in Commonwealth Act No. 671, is “total emergency” which means the state of actual war involving the Philippines, with the impending invasion and occupation of our country by the enemy and the consequent total disorganization and paralyzation of the Government, principally, the impossibility for the National Assembly to act. This was the only reason and justification for the total relinquishment of legislative power by Congress in favor of the Chief Executive under Commonwealth Act No. 671. Such relinquishment was total because the emergency was also total. Clearly, therefore, the inability of Congress to act was the soul of the law, and the moment such inability ceased, the total emergency also ceased and the law likewise ceased to validly exist. On June 9, 1945, the Congress of the Philippines convened in a special session “to adopt such measures as may be necessary to meet the existing emergency” and “for the purpose of considering general legislation.” I hold that from that date, June 9, 1945, Congress was able and ready to act on all matters, and the emergency powers delegated to the President in Commonwealth Act No. 671, naturally ceased to exist."

"Despite a “voluntary handshake agreement” stating the industry would not use diesel fuel and a legal exception, Halliburton used 7.2 million gallon of diesel fuel and BJ Services injected 11,555,538 gallon of diesel fuel into the ground between 2005 and 2009. The gas industry is challenging the federal legislator’s claim that they violated the law. Industry is arguing that there were no regulations in place despite their agreement to not use diesel fuel in fracking. In fact, 32 million gallons of diesel fuel was used in 19 states, of which half was injected in Texas, and one million gallons or more was used in the following states: Oklahoma 3.3 million gallons; North Dakota 3.1 million gallons; Louisiana 2.9 million gallons; Wyoming 2.9 million gallons; and Colorado 1.3 million gallons. It is difficult to believe or construe the oil and gas industry as anything other than a sociopathic criminogenic operation."
"Talking about Belle de Jour is going to be problematic, because my response to the film was a broader question that requires coverage of its own. So for the sake of clarity, I’m going to split this into two parts. The first is this piece about the movie.

"Gallstones (subsequent gall bladder removal) – In roughly November of 2003, I had severe indigestion and upper abdominal pain. For about four months, doctors at an urgent care facility (the one of it’s kind here at the time) kept telling me that my blood work didn’t indicate the need for an ultrasound (because they are so hard to do, right? ) to look for gallstones. I was repeated told I had IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and given medication that NEVER worked. But one day (roughly February 2004) the pain was so bad, and so high up, the only thing I could think to describe it was that I felt like I was having a heart attack. I knew I wasn’t having a heart attack. I was only 26 years old at the time, for crying out loud. So, for safety’s sake, my husband called an ambulance. Their initial EKG showed nothing wrong, which we expected, and they took me to the emergency room. The doctor there basically said he knew exactly what was wrong and skipped waiting on the blood work to come back and brought in an ultrasound machine. Yup! My poor gall bladder was filled to the rim with stones. I told the doctor what the other doctors had said and he was actually pretty pissed. He gave me some pain pills and referred me to a GI doctor. A short time later, I was admitted to the hospital for surgery to remove my gall bladder. I was pretty much told that was the standard, and only way, to deal with gallstones. I had it removed. I was shown acorn-sized stones that had filled my gall bladder over the past few months to the brim. Everything had gone well and I thought that was over. Boy was I wrong! A few years ago, when I began delving into natural remedies, I read that there ways to rid of gallstones without surgery. I was like, “Okay, coolness. Too bad I didn’t know this then.” But, when we saw the nutritionist for the first time, she explained that, despite what modern, conventional medicine says, yes, we do need our gall bladders. She explained that without it, my liver has been overworked and unable to properly digest my food, namely fats. All my food was being digested the same way, no matter what. Cholacol, bile salt supplement from Standard Process, was added after my first evaluation was complete and the difference was amazing! I will have to take Cholacol the rest of my life now. While I’m glad I have this option, as a prepper, I hate knowing I will be forever dependent on something I can’t get easily on my own. Aside from that, once this lifestyle change and healing is complete, it will be the ONLY thing I’m on! All my conventional, modern medications are now gone and I couldn’t be happier about that. So, as with the adenomyosis and endometriosis above, if you have gallstones, please contact me before opting for surgery. I’ll find some resources for you to look at to see about trying to get rid of those bad boys without resorting to unnecessary surgery. (*sigh* obligatory disclaimer: No, I’m not a doctor!)"
"Are you planning to have an athletic lifestyle or looking for sports adventure? If your answer is yes, then a good planning must be taken into consideration. When it comes to athletic action, comfort is one of the major concerns. Let’s take running for example. If you are planning to run every morning, you have to choose the right shoes for you. This is because if you run with the wrong shoes and with the wrong fitting, you cannot run well, you cannot perform well, and on top of that, your feet can get hurt and get injured. That would be the worst thing that can happen with your feet if you wore the wrong shoes. Another situation is, if you are going to work on your fitness training, and you wear the wrong shoes, you cannot last long because you can get very uncomfortable. This can be really annoying if you are not comfortable with what you wear. So the shoes are very important for athletic lifestyle."

"Harmlessly simple, isn’t it? Yet I suspect that my responses would be received by some as those of a religious fanatic. Here’s the thing: If I say I am a Christian but I don’t announce a firm faith, then my beliefs are merely preferential, which would completely obliterate my so-called faith. That’s not fanatical.* It’s passionate, but sensible. And because of my unalterable beliefs, I can disagree with other faiths without condemning their followers. I leave fanaticism for the hating."

"As soon as I said gossip, some of you had a picture of a person who gossips all the time pop into your head, wonder if anyone pictured you? Gossip has been an issue in the church for as long as it has been around but that does not make it right at all. We do a number of things to try to cover our tracks when it comes to gossip: we use the “prayer request” cover, we use the “I am only sharing this with you because I care” cover, or we use the “I am not gossiping because I am pretty sure it is true” cover. The Bible has some hard words for those who like to gossip. We should not associate ourselves with gossip or gossipers."

"“I’m very proud of my manhood. It’s the best part of my body, so I want to look after it. That’s why it’s important to raise awareness of testicular cancer; we need to be more open about our health, go for check-ups and take care of our bodies. I was actually quite shy on my photoshoot. I take off my shirt in front of thousands of people on stage, but when there are just a few people around, it’s nerve-racking. I said, ‘Just make sure the room is warm and I’ll be good’”."
"CR: I am just in love with Mozart. I wish I was his wife to know which folly these masterpieces would come out!"

"I make no promises that I will get it done in the next four months, pre-baby, but I'll do my darndest. In the meantime, I have the whole year. ;) I actually do have a gift I have to make for someone from over a year ago on another similar agreement, but I'll be good this year, I promise."

"Cohen, the sad thing is you're too dim to realize the evil of the unfettered government spending you're espousing. Because you're a mathematic ignoramus, a chronic putz, whose religion is Statism. You're a walking, talking joke."
"To my way of thinking the world IS “too much with us” and I have to fight that every day. I don’t want to “lay waste my Powers” and I need to constantly remind myself that all the “getting and spending” can’t give me more than what the world has to offer for free … not the least being this wonderful poem from William Wordsworth. I will heed his words and try to live by them."
"Hello world, and welcome to our blog! It is here that we will bring you all of the exciting news from our adventure across the country on our bicycles. We will post pictures, videos, stories, and whatever else we think you might find entertaining. We plan to set off on May 6th, 2012, but before we set off we need to find a charity to support. So help us out, please! If you know of any awesome charities that we could potentially fundraise for, let us know!!!! Send us an email, comment on something of ours, post on our Facebook page, call us, text us, send us a smoke signal, something! Well I guess that is all for now. Keep an eye out for more news about our trip. Thank you!"

"I’m starting to think our kitchen has more inventory than Williams-Sonoma as we find ourselves wading in gadgets and service pieces. It’s the one room that works overtime in our home, so things must have their place. I’m a big fan of open shelving, where things are both accessible and visible. It’s important to arrange them for function, but it also means they become display pieces, and it can be tricky to pull this off without looking cluttered."
"Lastly, I want to thank all of my readers so much for your support and sweet comments. I hit 300 followers today and feel so lucky to have this outlet and creative talent to share with others. I really appreciate each of you more than you may know, so thank you."

"The room faces East and North, the floors and walls were painted in different tones of Benjamin Moore whites. Some doors were removed and walls added to create a small entry of sorts and give this out of the way space, its own identity."

"Well after all the bad weather of late, what a cracker of a day we've had! It was really frosty first thing when I went for my run, but by the time the sun was up, the frost had shifted and it ended up being a lovely day - spent in the garden! & after such a busy day, I thought I'd turn out another card, and for some reason, I'm really in to doing Christmas cards at the moment! Think it's because I have several new stamps that I just want to see made up and can't wait till the end of the year!"

"Mallory realizes fairly quickly that Kenneth is the mastermind. Aside from personal conflict arising from Mallory having dumped him, Kenneth also has professional reasons for wanting Mallory out of the way. She's made it clear that she intends to defect from his agency and her reputation being what it is, he knows that many of his key clients would follow her to wherever she went next. Knowing what she does, Mallory sets out to turn the tables and make Kenneth (and his allies) regret coming after her. With a little help from a government contact (Michael Douglas) and an almost inhuman ability to not be killed, Mallory just keeps going and going, escaping one impossible predicament after another until she finally gets to have the showdown she wants and the answers she needs."
"I hate election day. I used to love it. I used to feel like my vote made a difference, and maybe it does. But I hate it now because I have to deal with these people...and they affect my every day life. And I don't like it. I really think that every single person in America should work in the media for one election season...and see what these people are like. It's a real eye opener."
"Apparently he continues to reside in Montana, keeping a low profile and complying with the requirements that he not represent himself as a priest in public. The lawsuit has not been withdrawn, though no action has been publicly announced. The various Facebook pages that rose up to support or criticize him have dwindled to a few members each, issuing regular shots at one another but providing no light."
"1. I love animals but to spend so much effort to rescue mistreated animals and to hate our fellow-man of any race, creed, religion and to know that 1 billion people are starving here on planet earth and do nothing and to know 3 billion people live on 1 to 2 dollars a day in poverty so bad you wouldn’t let the rescued animal live there. We the body of Christ can not sit back any longer and do nothing."

"While they may make good eatin’ for people, it’s the eating the giant shrimp do themselves that worries scientists."
"Elsewhere, Fr. Olivieri also points to the matter of “devastating motion”, which Bob has wrongly confused with the “elliptical orbits”. And Fr. Olivieri also points out scientific discoveries—e.g. stellar aberration and nutation—that cannot be explained by geocentrists without resorting to special pleading. Therefore, Bob’s contention that Fr. Olivieri makes “elliptical orbits” the “crux of the matter” is unsupported and false. Elliptical orbits was one of many things to which Fr. Olivieri pointed to demonstrate that the views of modern astronomers were not the same as those of Copernicus and hence not the same as what was addressed in the 1633 decree. Based on a false and sloppy analysis, Bob has repeatedly and unjustly accused this Catholic priest of lying and subterfuge. Such, it seems, is the typical approach of the neo-geocentrist."

I used Nicole's Bead Backing in dark purple because I wanted everything to be matchy matchy too... yes, that was Mrs. Type A speaking."

"Hall of Fame, New York Yankee great, Yogi Berra once said, “It ain’t over until it’s over.” That certainly is absolutely true about taxes. It is a continuing saga. Although the tax season is officially over for 2011 returns, “now what” is a question you might be asking yourselves right about now. Tax planning is still critical even after that 2011 return was electronically sent or dropped in the mail."

"My son Matthew normally doesn't like to eat cake. I know. I don't get it either. But we were recently at his friend's birthday party, and when all the games had ended and it was time to eat, he finished his pizza and then promptly told me he wanted to go home. I said we couldn't leave until we'd had birthday cake, to which he declared he didn't want any cake! I told him that he didn't have to eat any of it, but that he had to stay long enough to sing happy birthday and watch his friend blow out the candles."

"Overall, it was a great experience. Something fun and unexpected. Met some really nice people and got to see how things like this go behind-the-scenes. Oh, and the first picture of one of my kiddos popped up on the Infantino homepage. So if you just happen to pop over to infantino.com you might see her sweet little face."

It was wonderful to meet Arch Priestess Michelle, her husband and Arch Priest Eric, and the Maiden from up in Courtney-Comox, Dawn. Things are going to be moving quickly and steadily the next few months I think, and there will be more than enough to keep me busy while I'm off with Raisin."
"Apparently the way to counteract the war on freedom of association is to . . . attack others’ freedom of association. Whatever happened to that bedrock principle of free-market economics — freedom to choose whom you do business with?"

"With a wicked grin of arrogance, he gazed down at the pleading pale face. He pulled her upright and turned her to face him. The glowing emerald eyes staring back amused him, he smiled inwardly recognizing the tell-tale sign of dilated pupils, lust clearly reflected back. He inhaled deeply. Bloody bollocks! The woman has lusty thoughts. He instantly knew the arousal she felt was a natural reaction and nothing his vampire powers created. His cock got impossibly hard from being in such close proximity to her and this wasn’t the vampire beast begging for release."
"The rain is supposed to end soon, and the day become quite warm, how warm, no one is saying. You have to love it when the local meteorologists admit they aren’t sure exactly how warm it will get that day!"
"We just had one really big problem with getting the girls to the car. We had to turn in the double stroller and were just left with the one. We had to wake Lyric up to walk-thankfully she was groggy, but okay with it. Story and Cadence on the other hand both lost it when we woke them up! They both screamed for several minutes! I ended up carrying Cadence and Devon pushed Story in the stroller. They were both miserable while we waited for the ferry! Luckily, they calmed down on the ferry ride. We then had to catch the tram to drive us to our car. By the time we made it to the car we were all exhausted!"
"This does Atonement teach, and demonstrates the Oneness of God’s Son is unassailed by his belief he knows not what he is. Today accept Atonement, not to change reality, but merely to accept the truth about yourself, and go your way rejoicing in the endless Love of God. It is but this that we are asked to do. It is but this that we will do today."

"In a monogamous relationship, it's natural for a woman to want to see a little (or, umm, a lot?) of the unrestricted male. I don't mean violence, of course. That's where trust comes in. But for everyone's benefit, raising the gate on a few more basic instincts leads to a happier experience. How many times have I heard women ask:"
"I don't really have a favorite place. Sometimes my bed, on a cold day or the lawn chairs that over look Moonstone Beach in Cambria, CA at the Cambria Shores Inn. They serve goodies throughout the day for their guests and you can watch the Pacific Ocean with a cup of tea and a warm cookie."
"By 11PM worship was going full-steam ahead and there was no indication of when I would be sharing. The crowd had more than doubled in size, with 200 or so attending. The time could be best described using two adjectives, “expressive” and “jubilant”. I was taken back to books I’ve read on revivals of centuries past. One of the common-denominators in God-sent revivals is the way in which a congregation steps into a united pursuit of Jesus, regardless of whether they are being led by a worship leader or pastor. The Spirit of God begins leading others to sing out songs, seemingly random passion-filled praying, shouts of rejoicing, etc. I witnessed this happening. Goose bumps. What a work God is doing all around the world. And here I am, in just one small congregation in the midst of a massive city, watching Jesus smile upon His children and their hungering after Him. Do you ever get the feeling like God is setting you up for something grand? Something that you may every now and again get a small taste of? In reality, He’s setting us all up for eternal Heaven, but He’s also setting us up for Heaven flowing through the hands and feet of God-fearing saints right here, right now. Press in! Don’t give up. Our time is too short to lose track of what God wants to accomplish. I have many dreams that have remained unfulfilled, mainly a massive outpouring of the Holy Spirit on this generation that is undeniable even to the secular world perspective. But, here I am New York City, experiencing a trickling waterfall of God’s grace. Jesus makes all things New! New York City made New – That’s one thing Jesus showed me. When the Gospel takes center stage, entire cities are turned into bubbling expressions of the river of life. That is Biblical revival."
"Englewood is a restaurant town — and one in which many open and close frequently, due to the challenging economy. But some have managed to continue to thrive, despite the odds that are against them. One of these is Wild Nigiri — which operated under the name Wild Ginger for 15 years, and is owned by proprietor Charles Hamade."

"The jury at the High Court found that Mr Sheridan had lied about certain specific matters in his earlier evidence. It was not simply that he answered “no” when he should have said “yes” but instead that an alternate reality was created by him and put before the court, successfully as it turned out. I suspect that if he had lost his original claim for damages, no prosecution for perjury would have taken place."

"I had this plan"
"Don't get me wrong. As a published author, I am the last person to begrudge my publisher's bottom line. That said, as a reading consumer, I want to enjoy the benefits of the e-book platform at a reasonable (whatever that means) cost. Finding that balance remains an elusive goal. Something tells me that this so-called ""agency pricing"" model will not be the last word on the topic."
"The shell was a thing of beauty, held in the hand of my beautiful daughter. She found it at the base of a tree, after stopping next to this big sycamore and insisting I take her picture in the silver-white light of a mild winter Saturday afternoon. The shell surprised and delighted us, as it made up for the lack of river glass and freshwater clam shells we had set out to collect."
"Duryodhana, the main enemy of the Pāṇḍavas, sent the powerful sage Durvāsa with his thousands of disciples to dine with Yudhiṣṭhira while they were exiled in the forest. There was no way Yudhiṣṭhira could feed so many people, so Durvāsa would be inconvenienced. Durvāsa is famous for getting angry easily and cursing people seriously, so Duryodhana made this scheme in the hopes that Durvāsa would curse the Pāṇḍavas."
"And, she loves and supports the people who I love and support–my husband and kids."
"You may be wondering why I bothered listing the 'main ingredients' if most of them have scientific names which really don't make sense to the average person. One reason is, they were conveniently listed on the back *LOL*, and another reason is because I think it's important to know what we're putting on our skin. I'm not the biggest chemistry savvy person, but I did study it in high school and in my first year at university. Even though these ingredients are a great big mouthful, I think it's actually quite fun & eye-opening to learn more about what goes into the products I'm using."
"Age: 46 years old"
"I gathered in such seemingly unconnected elements such as clear quartz points, rat bones, bubblewrap, plastic door bead strings, Czech beads, tribal drops, sea glass, vintage lingerie fittings and art deco jewellery. I also made a list of things I wanted to have on hand but as yet did not- white chain, obsolete computer components, square beads and a home enamelling kit - the kind used for bathtub repair. Even the things I'd bought from Etsy that arrived that day fit perfectly into the scheme, even though when I bought them it was with Faginpunk very clearly in mind."

"David Morrissey – The Doctor"
"Hi Readers — Like the headline says: A Jersey boy, 11, found a lighter on his way to school. Brought it in, another kid noticed it, by 8:40 a.m. he was suspended for the day. Why? Because the lighter, “has the potential to compromise student safety in this building,” according to the superintendent quoted in this APP.com story. “It’s our responsibility to keep kids safe. I feel very secure about our decision. We have zero tolerance for this type of thing.”"
"Pride is on full display in Las Vegas. This sin is really at the heart of the Las Vegas experience. There is no sadder site than a bachelorette party where the bacherlorette in question wears a plastic tiara, drinks out of a gold plastic goblet encrusted with bling that spells out “Bachelorette” while kissing her girlfriends on the lips to the delight of all male passers-by. The bachelorette is the star of the show, and the afternoon I observed such a group poolside, any whim experienced by the bachelorette was to be fulfilled. Behaving as though in one of those ads on TV, the gaggle of girls faux-dirty danced with one another, taunting males with their girl-on-girl kisses, exagerrated outbursts of “Whoooo!!!!” and other activities which appeared pointless from my point of view, but surely stoked their imaginations as being celebrities and fabulous for a day (or afternoon)."
"what I love about the size of it, is that it fits you."
"Someone you thought was amazing, and someone that you believed also thought you were amazing, has left you. How could they have done this to you? Didn't they know how much you loved them? When you made it clear to them that you'd do anything for them so that you could be together, didn't they take that seriously? It just doesn't seem possible that they'd have chosen someone else over you. It certainly doesn't seem possible that they'd sought out someone else to replace you."

"I Can Do It! ¡Lo Puedo Hacer! Of course the first book I won was a children’s book, with zero description. I’m going to assume that it’s about a bi-lingual kid that can do a bunch of things, including running around in socks and a blanky cape. We’ll see what my kids think about it. I was a little annoyed at the PM I got from the author telling me to make sure I review it on goodreads and Amazon. Oh, and that she signed her name ‘Author,’ because I’m sure I would have just confused her for someone else who was asking me to review a book."

"Michael understood completely, because he’s responsible for my obsession with the Southern Vampire Mysteries in the first place. When rumors of True Blood began to circulate, he said, “Molly, you have to watch this. It’s going to be huge, and I know you love vampires as much as I do”. Which was true. I have always loved vampires and since Michael had lived with me for years, he knew all about my Buffy the Vampire Slayer obsession. I watched the DVDs all through college. But I never watch a show or movie without first reading the book, and when I looked into the premise of the series, it sounded pretty stupid. But then one day I was in The Dusty Bookshelf, my local used book store, and saw the paperback of Dead Until Dark for sale and thought, “what the hell”."
"3. I read recently in ""The 24"" that St. Paul's Hospital in Vancouver plans to open a 24-hour drop-off room where women can abandon their newborn children anonymously. My initial reaction to reading this was shock - general shock, about the whole topic. I'm not an ostrich with my head in the sand, I know that things like mothers abandoning their babies happen - it just caught me off guard reading about such a...what's the word I'm searching for...blunt (?!maybe?!) solution. I went on to read that 'Safe Haven' policies exist in all US states as well as several other countries, like Britain and Japan. Now, having read that, it surprises me that Canada has not yet got anything like this in place; however, the anonymity of the St. Paul's service will be a first in North America. The article says that hospital officials do not think this service will be used very frequently, and that they hope that it won't be used at all. Wow. This really gets me thinking about a lot of things. Makes me want to hug my children. Makes me want to hug the next teenage mom I see (not to imply that it's only and always teenagers who go this route), and makes me very, very thankful that I have been lucky enough to be able to conceive and carry three pregnancies to term and have them result in three healthy children. Never mind the piles of laundry, the messy floors, the daunting utilities bills, the petty annoyances/grievances with your neighbours or your co-workers or your spouse, etc. - gotta find a reason to stop each day and be thankful.

We’re just really proud of having him and love to show him off."
"2. Just to Be with You"
"Anyway, every time I go to Andy's Market there is a plethora of folks in their golden years navigating the aisles and who mysteriously seem to flock to me like bees to honey which I think has less to do with my personal charm, and more to do with the fact that I'm nearly 6 feet tall and I can reach all those rows of tofu sausages on the top shelf that are so popular in vegetarian communities."

"I wrote a little about rhythm in horror a while ago, which is a big one, and Hart Johnson made a great observation in the comments about The Shining and ""red rum."" It reminded me of another great storytelling tool: repetition. One of my creepiest childhood horror stories was about a young girl lying in bed while a disembodied voice comes closer and closer. ""Mary, I am coming up the stairs. Mary, I am on the first step. Mary, I am on the second step."" Good, creepy repetition works the best when the repeated line ramps up the tension."

"Bullying, a form of violence most often found among children and youth, is a means of using power and aggression in order to serve as control over someone or to cause distress to someone (Lamb et. al., 2009). It happens at home, in school, in sports, in recreational activities, in neighbourhoods, and in other community settings (Lamb et. al., 2009). Most recently, as we enter the more technologically advanced era, bullying happens on the Internet. Research suggests that unhealthy relationships are the root of unhealthy behaviour in children which leads to bullying and violence. One way of addressing this issue, as Pepler and Craig suggest, is by promoting healthy relationships (2011)."

"In light of this, my Facebook Profile page has grown and grown over the past two years - in particular - since I introduced The Independent Magazine content feeds to it three years ago. After some discussions with FB's Developer Support Team today, I've taken the decision to convert my FB profile over to an author and editor fan page for TIPM and my books. That 'porting' took place just before midnight, March 28th, and 95% of my 'Friends' list has transferred successfully across to the new author fan page. I'm told by FB Developers that the loss of 'Friends' during conversion is usually down to users who have discontinued or deleted their FB profiles. The conversion was always something I was going to have to deal with as my FB Profile was quickly reaching the limit allowed (5000). I'd rather act early with some discomfort and background work to do to re-install the aggregation, carry out some redesign, than have to face it eventually six months down the line."

"Indeed, it was for these great deeds that he recieved his knighthood from Richard himself and given the lay of the land. Since that day the family Fuckington had ruled the proles of stickfordshire with a stiff iron rod, often applied in a firm manner without the favour of anointment. With each generation came the story of that great forefather along with his personal effects; a manuscript written in the highest hyperbole telling of his adventures (written by an annoynmous scribe of that era; Roger himself was famous for his illiteracy), a broadsword and his coat of armor emblazoned with the family crest. These keepsakes were passed down the male side of the line, going to the first son of each generation, and often given pride of place in the grand entrance hall of the family home, safely kept in a locked glass cabinet to protect them from curious fingers. The cabinet remained locked on all but the second Sunday of each month during which its contents was cleaned and polished to a brilliant shine."
"I’ve painted too. When I was a freshmen, we had an event in my dorm called worship painting. It was really cool. We prayed about a word that just stuck out to us.

It was pretty cool and interesting to see where the painting took us."

I don’t think anyone would look at her and think of her as someone who would be popular, or even someone who would hang out with the popular kids. On Tuesday evening, the teens participated in a talent show. This girl walked onto the stage and, without saying a word, put on her guitar and began to play the opening chords to Stairway to Heaven. When she finished, 300 people rose to their feet, cheering, clapping, and calling for an encore. Later on, she and one of the teen staff members, a young man who is a semi-professional musician, were jamming in a lounge area."

Of course I get asked if I want some. I can either give in and eat what the rest of the family's having, or I can step back and make a healthier choice. I did that tonight and am proud of that small accomplishment. My husband had to work tonight and he and my daughter both had chicken nuggets from McDonald's. He asked me if I was going to pick up something for myself. I told him, ""No, I'll fix something at the house."" And that's what I did. I ended up with a butternut squash ravioli and stayed within my calorie range for the day. That's one more step toward meeting my goal!"
"But I digress. For me one of the most difficult questions arising from the post-humanism that arises from flat ontology is the question of how it requires us to rethink the nature of the ethical and political. When we reject the centrality of the human within being, treating the human and social as two system-references among others rather than the ground of all others, what consequences follow for how we think the ethical and political? There are a couple of options we can follow here. One would be to recognize that ethical claims are inherently object or system-specific. Here we get the sort of humanism that Scu worries about as following from flat ontology. The idea here would be something like the thesis that we have recognized the contingency of the human way of relating to the world (i.e., that other objects are organized in very different ways and therefore relate to the world in very different ways), but we are, at the end of the day, human and must therefore treat all other entities according to our own organization."

"With most publishers an advance usually reflects your book’s earning potential the first year it’s on sale, less costs to the publisher. What does that mean? Traditionally when publishers run those elusive numbers they try to figure in how many copies a book will sell it’s first year in print, then they try to figure out how much it’s going to cost them to make that book—design the cover, pay for paper, printing, and shipping costs—and then they will figure out how much you might make on the book based on your royalty percentage. And that’s your advance. It’s your share of the book’s profit its first year in print. Of course the publisher (and you) hopes you far exceed that number and that first royalty statement blows the advance out of the water."

"By proclaim I mean “to make apparent and/or known”, and Christians ought to do so without subtlety or craftiness. We say with St. Paul: “BE RECONCILED TO GOD!” We make things known by our actions and by our words. If I’m wearing basketball shorts, walking toward the park with a basketball under my arm, I’m making it known that I’m going to play basketball. Actions speak. Likewise, speaking is acting. Talking is an activity. Everything we do speaks and everything we speak is an action. So it is with our whole life that we proclaim the Gospel because the Gospel informs every facet of our lives. The Gospel tells us who we are, tells us how to act, and tell us what to say with our words and with our deeds."

In this case, it was a Best Picture winner, beating more deserving movies like L.A. Confidential and Good Will Hunting, both of which had better stories, better acting, and better writing. L.A. Confidential, had it won, might have made a run in this tournament."

"To complete the sea-aging experiment, BrewDog found an old recipe--either 150 or 200 years old; their material quotes both ages. Given that agriculture has changed so much in that time (not to mention the earth's climate), I don't imagine that the beer they brewed tastes like the ancient inspiration. The brewery used ancient English hops, but probably only Goldings (born in the 1780s) date back 200 years. Fuggles, the other hop in the recipe, is also an old strain, but is about a century younger. Maris Otter is typically used to approximate historic malts--as BrewDog has done with Atlantic IPA--but I have no idea how similar it is to the malts of the early-to-mid 19th Century. Still, the recipe seems a worthy effort to replicate an old recipe given ingredients available in the 21st Century."

"Then, the other one might try to either explain what happened from their perspective, or in many cases, if they know that there really is not an explanation, they learn to say something along the lines of ""I am sorry that I hurt your feelings.

"And it’s about the problems of communication again and knowledge transmission in the culture as a whole, because like so many others, I’ve created a scenario where all the cell phones stop working. No internet. And no internet basically means no books for most people at this point in time. So there’s a kind of nostalgia rising that I’m not entirely comfortable with. Also, though: no news. So most people have no idea what’s happening. Nearly everyone is in the dark about it."

"I won't hold up pretenses - I came to Shirley Collins music by way of tracing the influences of my influences when I was thinking of myself as a songwriter. It's a practice I've kept up even though I'm no longer actively writing / composing -- I believe it's called ""research"" by those music conservatory types of people. For me it meant listening to certain records very deeply and often, paying close attention to writing credits and liner notes. THIS was my (informal) music education, and I would trace genealogies of musicians and writers to arrive at mutual fonts of inspiration. This was in the days before music blogs and the instant-gratification of internet sharing communities (before long after listening to music on wax cylinders, lest any readers think that I am absolutely ancient). The days when you had to literally hunt down music by haunting used record and CD shops, making real-life-flesh-and-blood friends with similar interests, or even visiting a public library or two. For music from my own home continent, North America, that's meant going back to some of the earliest material available thanks to dedicated and largely independent labels interested in divulging it. For English music, my interests started with Fairport Convention and sprouted like a weed to Pentangle, Steeleye Span, Davy Graham, and eventually landing at the foot of the Great Mother of them all, Shirley Collins. And there it more or less stops. I could dig deeper some day, I suppose. (Incidentally I discovered the records of Nick Drake and The Incredible String Band along the course of this musical sojourn, rather than the river flowing in the other direction -- I just had to put that in there to show ""I was there before it was HIP!"" thanks to the neo-freak-folk phonies or whatever they are calling themselves, if they still exist at all)."

"The high school was still the same, a massive building surrounded by hilly, green, lush lawns in the front and a track in the back. This is where I met my husband. I was sixteen at the time and he seventeen. I took my daughter through my memory lane pointing to the side door where her father used to exit waiting for me to pass by so he could say hello; something that made this shy girl a bit uncomfortable. I knew him to be gregarious and a guy all the girls seemed to love. I knew this and so had no interest. I was never going to be one of the girls he always seemed to be surrounded by, confident girls whose social graces exceeded mine, girls who conversed easily, appeared comfortable in their own skins, and seemed more interesting, prettier. It didn't matter that my heart fluttered each time I saw him, as far as I was concerned, he was someone who would never be interested in me. I don't know if my shyness or my indifference were the contributing factors, but the more he failed to connect with me, the more he became interested and pursued. We were a challenge to each other for different reasons."

"I have to confess to being even worse with historical fiction. If I find an unintended anachronism or sloppy factual inaccuracies, I will not finish the book. Partly because I consider it to be 'my' genre, I don't like people playing fast and loose. I don't like history being used as a mere backdrop for adventures that involve lots of galloping about and where boys fight and girls flounce. I don't like books that deal in ill considered cliche or unquestioning nostalgia. I want a book that uses the freedom that writing fiction gives to look at history from a different angle, to tell me something I don't know, or makes me look at something familiar in a new way. Knowledge has to be matched with thought and imagination. At the other end of the spectrum, I don't like authors who have obviously done a mass of research and are going to make sure we know it, putting all those hours in the library to good effect by stuffing the narrative with endless facts."

"...why do we even care about this stuff? So Tom McCarthy — or whoever it was you might have wanted to win — didn’t get a prize. Does it really matter? By and large, awards like the Booker are intended to promote solid, well-written, more or less middlebrow fiction — the kind of books that broadsheet newspapers tend to give coverage to. And that’s surely a good thing for the publishing industry, for the literary editors of papers that still have books pages, for the small number of writers who get the nod, for booksellers and (I would guess) for the manufacturers of those stickers that get slapped with startling speed onto the dust jackets of shortlisted titles. But does it really matter at any other level — at the level, for instance, of literary culture as opposed to the publishing industry? I’m not convinced it does. He then goes on to make a set of fairly common (and true) observations about literary prizes--that not everyone who deserves one gets one, that some of the past winners don't hold up well, that the prizes don't really reflect literary merit, and so forth. His argument, at its core, goes something like this: if a prize doesn't line-up with actual merit or import, then the prize really doesn't deserve the amount of attention it gets."

"Apart, of course, from reviewers. Strangely enough, my first venture into journalism was reviewing children’s books. I was 18 and working as a messenger girl on a national paper and Sharon, the editor of the children’s page gave me some books to review. The very first one was about a hamster. I enjoyed writing reviews, and I loved seeing my name in print. I spared not a moment’s thought for the poor author of the hamster book, reading and re-reading my verdict on her work. I went on to review many books. I never thought about the authors. I especially liked hardback books, because I could sell them at the second hand book shop. It's only now, as a writer, that I appreciate the power that I wielded."
"Many left as well as mainstream economists point to “economic growth” rather than austerity as what is needed to address the crisis of joblessness. One of the extremely serious contradictions that entails is the environmental fallout from capitalist growth. The more the economy grows, the more it degrades the planet, through pollution, squandering of natural resources, or direct destruction of ecosystems that are turned into plantations, pastures, mines, roads or cities."

"Perhaps no apostle enjoyed a more productive ministry career than Paul; and judging from the letters of the New Testament, no apostle asked others to pray for him more than Paul. A coincidence? I doubt it. “And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ,” he wrote to the Colossians (4:3). “Brothers, pray for us,” he directed the Thessalonians (1 Thess. 5:25). “Finally, brothers, pray for us that the message of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you. And pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men, for not everyone has faith,” he asked them again (2 Thess. 3:1-2). And if he wrote the book of Hebrews, as many suspect, he also made the identical request of them. See Hebrews 13:18."

"In these difficult financial times it is imperative that we allocate the library’s collection budget in a manner that will provide the best tools for the majority of our users. Unfortunately that means having to make difficult decisions regarding resource cancellations. The CU system libraries have decided to cancel their supporter membership to BioMed Central effective April 10, 2012. Please rest assured that almost all of BioMed Central’s content is open access so Anschutz Medical Campus users will continue to maintain access to the journal articles. The CU system libraries are cancelling our supporter membership which gave authors a 15% discount on the author fees to publish in a BioMed Central journal. What the CU system libraries found after reviewing our supporter membership is that very few faculty took advantage of the discount and that even with the discount faculty members still had to pay a large fee."
"Feel free to watch it in its entirety, but what I wanted to point out from it was that in her angry vent, the wife expresses dismay towards the “other woman”, to which Judge Judy replies that she owes her nothing. That she isn’t the one who broke their marriage contract, and that she best take a closer look at her husband, instead of placing the blame on the mistress. I can see both viewpoints, but I disagree entirely on this position of letting the mistress whore off scott-free. If this were a sandbox scuffle, mama bear would have come in and punished both, no?"

"In spite of Nietzsche’s criticism of the romantics, his outlook owes much to them; it is that of aristocratic anarchism, like Byron’s, and one is not surprised to find him admiring Byron. He attempts to combine two sets of values which are not easily harmonized: on the one hand he likes ruthlessness, war, and aristocratic pride; on the other hand, he loves philosophy and literature and the arts, especially music. Historically, these values coexisted in the Renaissance; Pope Julius II, fighting for Bologna and employing Michelangelo, might be taken as the sort of man whom Nietzsche would wish to see in control of governments. It is natural to compare Nietzsche with Machiavelli, in spite of important differences between the two men… Both have an ethic which aims at power and is deliberately anti-Christian, though Nietzsche is more frank in this respect. What Caesar Borgia was to Machiavelli, Napoleon was to Nietzsche: a great man defeated by petty opponents."
"Two weeks ago, Heilbron dairy farmer Christo van Rensburg was attacked by a group of black males who threw burning petrol-bombs into his car which set his clothes alight. Then they dragged him from his vehicle and started beating him – but the Afrikaner freed himself, tore off his burning clothes and ran to the safety of his heavily-secured homestead. Dutch farmer Bouke Tack now is a paraplegic with a bullet in his spine after five armed black males gunned him down in a rain of bullets at his Golden Valley dairy farm on 18 March 2012. Thirty-five-year old Mrs Riana Schoeman was also shot dead while fighting for the lives of her small children on their dairy farm near Cullinan. And the SA-Dutch dairy farmer Loffie van der Gryp was shot dead like a dog at his milking sheds on his dairy farm near the world-famous Sterkfontein caves near Pretoria. There’s also evidence that black police officers are involved in these attacks: dairy farmer I G Siemens was killed assassination-style at Mets dairies in Tzaneen in 2002: and two black police officers were found guilty by the court. In fact a large family from Randburg, attacked three times within a year-period, told up and fled to the USA where they are now awaiting their application for political asylum, stating that they were only attacked because of their ethnic origin."

"The price of crude oil is a perpetual issue in the world, for as long people can drill and pump oil from the ground, this commodity would shape up the world society in so many ways. Oil is so essential that some are willing to wage war for this precious commodity, to make sure that their supply of oil would not run out, and who can blame them? The world’s economy depends on oil, every country needs oil for their own industries, that’s why you’re lucky if your country happens to be an oil exporter. It’s no different here in the Philippines. With the price of oil going nowhere but up, panic and despair reigns in society. Transport groups are holding strikes and rallies in the streets, with other militant groups throwing in their support for the cause. These rallies are held to call the attention of the government, to make the government hear their pleas. Their aim is simple; they want the price of oil to go down and they want the government to intervene in behalf of them for they believe that the petrol corporations are at fault. It’s always the fault of the private sector, if anything goes wrong in the economy it’s because of corporate greed and this is the precise reason why there is a need to regulate them, well according to these militant groups. While I do agree that some people are just inherently greedy, government control is not the answer to that, I believe that a greedy and corrupt government is much much more dangerous than a greedy and corrupt corporation. And it’s quite amusing for these groups to ask the government to intervene in behalf of them, when some of them are also protesting about the lack of freedom in the country, about the lack of democracy in the country. Are they really unaware that the very thing that they are asking for the government also undermines individual freedom and democracy? Irony much?"

"I got a call at 3 AM from my mom saying that Gram was being taken to the hospital. Dad had already left and she didn't have her truck, so she asked if I could take her. Of course. I got up as fast as I could, and made the drive to my mom's house. On the way, I called my sister because I knew she was spending the night over there, baking with Gram. Her voice, and what she told me made my heart sank. ""It's not good ."" What does that mean? I could not comprehend the situation and it was all I could do to not speed on the way to the hospital. She told me in detail what had transpired in the past 2 hours, and I was further confused. In the shortened version, basically Gram had symptoms of food poisoning, followed by a severe headache, and then passing out."

"Harris, effectively, has admitted as much. “One form of teaching in this public-ness in this adjectival sense,” he noted, “asks students to consider how their lives are connected to and shaped by social forces and events.” Writing courses could be oriented around service learning, where “students collaborate with local activists”—on a topic, of course, pre-selected by the professor. Or the classes could have students comment on current affairs—screened, again, by the teacher. Harris celebrated one Duke class where students were asked to write about campaign against sweatshops and whether the Chronicle should have rejected an ad opposing reparations for African-Americans—two issues of great concern to the academic far left."

But we’re trying to do what we’ve always done, which is provide people with reading material and information for their edification and entertainment. Already, in the world of reference, online is the way to go. And as the world goes online, public libraries play an increasingly important role in providing online access and guidance for those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and internet access on their own. Possibly general interest books will go largely digital, too. But I think it will be awhile. The Monroe County Library’s ebook collection, as of this writing, is 549.

But he didn’t really make her up; he simply was growing into the ability to separate reality from fantasy. I didn’t take it personally and we still laugh about it."

"The first day basically involved me being very extreme when I or my roommates used any amount of water at any given moment (I’m sure I drove them crazyJ). I started out by participating in the old-fashioned art of hand washing my clothes and letting them hang dry. That wasn’t too hard and made me feel like I was already making a huge difference. This act was then followed by taking a bath instead of a shower and hand washing dishes in a sink filled with soapy water. As I said, I was very good about doing these tasks in the first couple of days. But then again, that was the weekend."

"The films which I’ve been writing about lately have all been fairly heavy on symbolism and meaning, so maybe it’s time to dip into something lighter for a change. As such, I feel that a tight, solid mystery that has no pretensions of being anything other than a piece of entertainment is as good a choice as any under the circumstances. This seems a fair summation of 23 Paces to Baker Street (1956) – a not especially well-known thriller that nevertheless features an intriguing plot and polished, professional work from all the participants. The movie belongs in a small sub-genre of films (e.g. The Spiral Staircase, Rear Window, Wait Until Dark) where the hero/protagonist is suffering from either a temporary or permanent disability. There’s nothing particularly exploitative about these films, the disability in question serving merely as a means of increasing tension or suspense – and often, paradoxically, emphasising the superiority of the hero over the villain."

"I HATED the film. HATED it. However, it is sometimes quite enjoyable to hate something. I kept on making a repetitive head-shaking motion throughout it and John kept on looking at me and laughing. The Woody Allen-alterego Owen Wilson plays is a hack-screenwriter who wants to write a Great American Novel, which in Allen's perception (as well as the mainstream canonical perception) is exclusively male and connects of course to Fitzgerald and Hemingway. The character enters some sort of campy dreamscape at midnight while wandering around Paris where he finds himself suddenly in the Lost Generation's 20s, and Gertrude Stein played by Kathy Bates who plays Gertrude Stein like she's a gregarious yet butchy Minnesota housewife reads his tepid realistic novel about a nostalgia shop, and he hangs out with Hemingway and Zelda and Scott, and a femme-enfant played by Marion Cotillard who is Picasso's mistress. Allen treats these figures of modernism like a Disneyworld exhibit, like It's A Small World Afterall or some nonsense, they're played for campy jokes and one-liners, which is fine, in the case of Dali, who babbles about rhinoceros for a few minutes on screen, but in the case of Stein and the Fitzgeralds, who have repeated scenes, comes off as really grossly laughable and not saying anything particuarly interesting about that period or the human condition or why we cling to these myths. Zelda is played rather brothily by the actress Allison Pill, and Allen of course just replays all the easy myths - she is depicted as not even charming but just off her meds, at one point in the film Owen Wilson and Marion Cotillard find her dippy self about to jump into the Seine, no real reason is given, except that she's a crazy chick, and she babbles something about how Scott doesn't love her anymore, and Wilson steps in and firmly hands her shoulders and is all like - No, Scott only has eyes for you, I know that - and the joke is supposed to be that Wilson as a contemporary reader understands the Fitzgerald mythology, even though even Scott's biographer would admit that Scott totally played around and fucked actresses, etc., and the idea that Zelda's scenes she threw was only due to some girlish jealousy is really quite bogus, a word she would have used. The scene with them and Hemingway is so ridiculous, and I feel like Woody Allen read Hemingway's A Movable Feast on the toilet or something and went with that. Zelda is all like (to Hemingway) Did you read my story? Like a dumb girl, and Hemingway didn't, of course, and Scott weakly protests to him that she has talent, as if Scott was Zelda's agent or something, and she storms off, and Hemingway tells Scott that Zelda is standing in the way of his talent, and then later on Owen Wilson is remembering the evening, and remembering that Hemingway is right - that Zelda stood in the way of Scott's genius, but of course he was so in love with her the Wilson romantic understood. The idea that these women stood in the way of their husband's masterpieces, as opposed to midwifing them and helping steward them along, serving not only as inspiration but copyeditors, etc., is so much part of our contemporary romantic consciousness and Allen's film is just a microwaved version of these stories that brew inside the men who have the confidence to want to be the Next Big Thing, while girls just want to go throw themselves into a great body of water and wash away. And Djuna Barnes appears as a punchline - Owen Wilson is Charlstoning with some women, it is pointed out to him that it was her, and he says, ""No wonder why she wants to lead,"" and Alice B. Toklas answers the door but isn't even given a line."

"First, a novel about a teenage bean sidhe should have been fascinating, but every few pages flattened me with either an information dump or passionate kissing, which brings me to my next point...There was SO. MUCH. PDA. Every kiss, every hug, every touch was described in excruciating detail (not everything in the novel, like thoughts or scenery, but every-single-little-thing to do with Nash). To the author's credit, Kaylee, while overly passionate, at least didn't venture into inappropriate territory. Lastly, Kaylee and Nash ""fell in love"" (note the quotation marks) way too fast. The guy talked her down from one little (metaphorical) ledge and she uses that event to justify all of his subsequent actions by reasoning that he must be a good guy since he was nice to her that one time."
"After that, did we even notice the meal? Yes we did, though when the waitress came back and asked us what we wanted, we said, we're here for the Supper...she said, You'll split that, then? That seemed odd, but we figured she knew what she was talking about, and did she ever: the 'supper' came on one big plate, and it was a great pile of stuff! A man at the next table also got it, just for himself (his date got the tartufo pizza), and my hat's off to him, Diary: he finished it and mopped up the gravy! The sirloin was tasty and tender in a crackling coating of crisp breading, the gravy was smoky and flavorful, the grits were dense and delicious, the spinach was silky. The only disappointment was the biscuit; just barely warm, a bit tough, and for being called ""sharp cheddar,"" it didn't really come through on the cheesiness. Still, 4 out of 5, Diary! I had a Southampton Burton Pale Ale with dinner, and it was quite nice, flavorful but not intrusive, and a good beer with the food."
"I do believe that the “whatayagonnado” is quite different than giving up, however, and I want to make it a point to say that. Giving up implies failure, it implies the negative connotation of admitting defeat. Those are passive actions. In my mind, the power of the “whatayagonnado” is about actively deciding to stop investing your energy into a particular issue. It means that you have the option to continue worrying, fighting, pursuing an issue, but you have decided to instead come to peace with the way the cards have been played."
"The best and the worst thing about Hellboy 2 is how it looks. As I mentioned, for the second installment Guillermo Del Toro has dispensed with a human protagonist, and along with it, any real grounding in the world of man. Humans here do little more than scream and run away, and even the awesome Jeffrey Tambor is pretty much put on the shelf by the time the real action gets going. Hellboy 2 is immersed in the world of demons, fairies and trolls, with Del Toro exercising his creature-concepting skills to their fullest - it's like the original Hellboy has merged with the fantasy sequences of Pan's Labyrinth. All this gorgeousness and grotesquery - the troll market, Tooth Fairies, the Golden Army itself - makes for a visual feast, but it also weighs down the action sequences. When there's so much to look at and so many details to play with, it becomes harder to block out action sequences that don't look entirely like cartoons. There's nothing here as adrenaline-pumping as Hellboy 1's fight scene in the New York Subway."

"I’m always irked when a book opens with a section on “how to use this book.” If you can read, you can use a book. Paltrow explains that to each recipe she has attached a variety of symbols: make ahead, quick, vegetarian, vegan, one-pot meal and dress-up meal. Thanks. I think I can figure out for myself that if the prep time is 10 minutes, it’s quick, and that roasted cauliflower is vegetarian. Paltrow also disappoints when she suggests how to “make it vegan” for many meals. Leaving out cheese, or replacing chicken with vegetables, may make a meal free of animal products, but where is the vegetarian protein? Calling a meal vegan that skimps on taste and protein is an easy way out and a disservice to a growing vegan population. Frankly, I would have expected more from Paltrow."

"The underlying problem is one of selection bias: if an intelligent and informed person thinks the Bible is probably true and therefore significant, he or she is more likely to pursue a career in biblical study and then publish his or her findings (confirming that the Bible is true). If, however, an identically-qualified person thinks the Bible is probably false and therefore not significant, he or she is dramatically less likely to trundle off to seminary regardless, and is exponentially less likely to publish his or her findings confirming that the Bible is false. Robert M. Price is the rare exception — someone who finds Christianity to be false historically but nevertheless powerfully inspiring, and therefore worth devoting his life to studying. (Richard Carrier is another exception — someone who finds Christianity to be false and is active in the atheist community. But these are the proverbial exceptions that prove the rule.)"

"First was the setting. This is a historical YA novel, that takes place in NYC (specifically Queens, in the 1930s, and then Manhattan, in the 1940s) and the way that Joe portrayed this place absolutely made it come alive. I've read some articles about how much work Joe did researching the little things (like the New York Subway system as it existed at the time), and it probably helps that Joe lives in NYC, but even that doesn't explain the vibrancy with which he breathes life into this setting. You'll notice what I mean immediately if you decide to read this book."

This isn’t a film for everyone. In fact, I venture to say, that not many have seen it, or would want to. I’m not going to rate this film. Nor recommend it. Didion already did that. You should be able to make a decision to watch it from the trailer. It’s up to you."
"This beer is not for those who don't like hops. It was a great combination of the malt with the double hops though. Although the bitterness and hops are in your face from the beginning, it wasn't overwhelming.

Sometimes I bottle it in individual bottles using old store bought Kombucha bottles, old beer bottles or swing top bottles. (I bought a beer capper at Amazon for $15.) This time I just poured it in old yogurt containers, old juice bottles and a pickle bottle! Don't store Kombucha in plastic, it will kill the SCOBY."

"Finally, Shugborough-Tweedle have created a single-use disposable pen for suicidal people. Each carries enough ink for one letter, and it writes wonderfully. Sadly, though, I found that it does tend to run out quickly if you ramble on about how you thought your life would get better once you’d had the patio refitted and nobody noticed your new hairstyle even after they told you to make more of an effort if you wanted to make Janice jealous after she ran off with Marcus, although she shouldn’t blame herself because before you met her your life was a barrel of rotten pigs’ trotters and she’ll always be close to your heart."

"HHH defeated CM Punk to keep his position as COO with a Pedigree. Wow, this match was difficult to call because both are faces. The amazing thing is they both stay that way. We had action all throughout the match, Spanish Announce Table was trashed, monitors flying around, Michael Cole losing his voice, sledgehammers, gym bags, DX Chops, Randy Savage Elbow Drop, and the kitchen sink all wrapped up in one. During the middle of the match, Awesome Truth came in and beat both men down. Then we had a ref bump, John Laurinaitius came down to the ring, checking on the ref, distracting the other ref when HHH had the first pedigree, and then he tweets something to Kevin nash, who came down to the ring through the crowd and beat both men down. He gave Punk a Jackknife Powerbomb for good measure. He lays HHH out with a vicious lariat clothesline, and took the monitors off the table to give HHH a Jackknife Powerbomb, but HHH counters by decking him with a sledgehammer, we had to see that. Punk tried a leg drop, but is countered with a Pedigree in mid-air, and the match is over with, to end the show."
"I think that religion is just a man-made thing. I don’t see the point in all of the extreme religious ceremonies, traditions, rules, and protocols. They exist to make people feel better, to give people something to believe in, to give us hope. I remember going to church when I was younger and I could not understand how my religion was the only right way to go. It didn’t seem fair that only Christians would go to heaven and everyone else in the world is doomed to hell."
"With that said, I seemed to have found a new lease this week and have 3 layouts to share with you."
"""Something is getting under your skin. Maybe it's that you've worked really hard for a better life in some way, and it continues to elude you. Maybe it's that someone in your world is causing unnecessary friction over a non-issue. Maybe it's that too much is expected of you in your work environment, and you're not properly respected or compensated for it. But whatever it is, it's nagging at you. While you may not be able to immediately resolve this issue, Moonchild, you don't have to suffer from it either. Your life is slowly but surely getting better.

"Felsted has yet another 12th century church and I suspect a Saxon one stood there for a while before this time. Again possibly this spot was used as a pagan site even before the Romans began their tour of Brittanica. A lovely church, closed today sadly while they spend money renovating the place. Nice door at the base of the tower, with a Norman arch (please confirm)."

"While Fi and I have many similar interests (like movies, reading, cooking, family, being outdoors, Judaism, our dog etc) nothing seemed fitting for a wedding. However, I wanted our wedding to be romantic and I love love love linked hearts. They're romantic, cute and best of all they represent the two of us coming together. I honestly feel as though my heart is linked to his. And just so you know, I felt like a dork typing that."

LOL, Andrew and I have thrown enough potlucks together to notice that no matter what this will always happen. So we always over compensate....but this time....we arent gonna. So we shall see what happens. (is this a silly problem that you all have too, or is it just me?) And I understand that most of our friends are on a ....college budget, but seriously, potatoes arent that expensive.....or even like, garlic bread? LOL!"
"From the fan’s point of view the outcome of the draft is going to be the future of your franchise and many dedicated fans, like myself, invest lots of time scouting, reading draft guides as well as being glued to ESPN and NFL Network everyday until the draft. The draft makes or breaks their team’s outcomes in later years. Thus, bringing an extremely high excitement factor to it, not only to the fans but to the personal that work so hard for their team. Many general managers either make or break their jobs over the NFL Draft, if you are a GM and have two or three bad years of drafting prospects and evaluating talent then you are more than likely to be let go."
"She goes on to say that most of us have to decide what we're going to give up in order to make art a priority, such as TV and the internet (except for blogging, of course). I have to agree; it's all about prioritizing. I rarely watch TV, except for the news and a couple of other shows. I don't have a social life, and my house probably isn't the cleanest, if you know what I mean. My husband graciously does most of the cooking. I try to answer emails, but sometimes it takes me a while. Sometimes I forget to respond to comments on my blog posts, but that's due to the age of my brain, and is not at all intentional."

"But back to that American Pale Ale. Beer lovers know that the ""American"" in American Pale Ale refers to the style of pale ale -- in this case, a bitter type pale ale. I brought a few over to a poker game the other night and got some interesting reactions from the international crowd. But indeed it was the Americans who assumed American meant ""watery"" in this case. They seemed to think a Japanese brewer was trying to reproduce that ever-so-American Budweiser sensibility."

Mostly, I wish that society would 'get a clue'. For Britney's story symbolizes a lot of the sins of mankind, that we judge, we are self-righteous, that we can turn on someone at the first sign of weakness and that charity is only extended to those who are similar to us."

I latched onto a guy in a blue shirt but I started to worry he was a bit too fast. I tried to slow myself down because I really think I only have one fast mile in me right now and don't think I have the fitness yet to recover if I go out too fast."

It’s amazing how you can tell yourself “oh, he is just not feeling well” or “he’s teething and is having a hard time staying asleep.” You really do just make excuses and give in until you are totally giving into everything."
"The main stage production of Kaufman and Hart's You Can't Take It With You, directed by John Glass followed. It also was greeted by an appreciative audience that was entertained by both the antics on the stage and the special effects emanating from back stage. Since The Ancient One was in the cast, Milton Chen graciously agreed to take pictures, 2 of which follow (with a plan to bring forth more at a later date)."
"The Tuluvas argue that there are several distinct features of Tulu Nadu that separate it from the rest of Karnataka, and give it an exclusive Tuluva flavour."
"I find the Japanese cocktail very enjoyable. The combination of the mellow brandy and the nutty, rich orgeat is tremendously extravagant. The bitters here are crucial. Historically the Japanese calls for Boker's, but this is one situation where the presence of aromatic bitters far outweighs the brand choice. It aptly combines sweetness in a inoffensive way, especially in light of its strength--two ounces of brandy is nothing to shake a stick at. After all, it is an early variation of the Old-Fashioned. But no matter how much lipservice I dare give it, the truth is that the Japanese cocktail doesn't get made very much at my house."

"Between idea conception and present day, the Paint by Number art phenomenon has come full circle. In the 1960s it was adopted into the realm of Pop Art. Then, in the 1970s the designs became more abstract to fit the maturing tastes of art enthusiasts. By the 1990s, Paint by Number was looking for ways to regain a footing in the craft market of America; a telephone survey led them to create the “America’s Most Wanted” kit. Around this time, numerous children’s art companies, like Crafthouse and Janlynn started to produce Paint by Number kits for kids; there are even designs inspired by Disney Characters."
"I recently read a pretty disturbing article written for a small newspaper that was posted on its website and quickly removed by the editor. Some have opined that the inflammatory article was posted for page hits, and page hits it did get. I’m not linking to it or naming the paper because I’m not into helping that paper get more page hits, and the article has been taken down anyway. But the editor’s apology note was qualified with the statement that the author’s attempt at sarcasm missed the mark. Having had some experience with sarcasm, it got me thinking. Sometimes when I think, I write. Sometimes when I write, I share. (Although I share very rarely here these days. Sorry, yo.)"

"But that is to be expected. From Tony Blair – First World – all the way down to Najib Razak – of the Altantuya and Scorpene submarines notoriety – is not something to be proud of. It is rather insulting in fact, although fees are fees and it is not clear yet if Campbell is indirectly linked to any firm that may be advising Najib now that another UK firm, FBC Media, is out of the picture, and on the verge of bankruptcy after undertaking a similar sort of public relations job for the Malaysian leader."
"‘Old Dogs’ is a heist caper, a modern farce, an adventure, a Carry-On movie on acid. The twists and turns are impossible to predict and it is to her credit that no matter how ridiculous the sets of events might be she manages to make them seem entirely credible, in part because the motives of all those who inhabit the book are so deeply believable."
"3D was a huge accomplice in these kinds of films too, with Jane Russell knocking both your eyes out and daggers flying right at your head. And just as in-your-face as these was William Castle, the undisputed king of ""gimmicks"". He knew what people wanted in films - to be entertained, even if there was no entertainment to be had onscreen. Just give 'em a mild electric shock in their seats, ghosts appearing and disappearing, skeletons flying high overhead... that'd hold 'em. No doubt about it, there was a whole fun house of thrills to be had with a ""gimmick film""."

"The photographs displayed here are simple: a family doing ordinary things in ordinary places. This collection represents a season of our family life, literally and figuratively. Other seasons will come and go, and with my Canon hanging from my shoulder by its patchwork strap, I will continue to document our “ordinary” life. As my father did before me, I will leave a legacy in the form of photographs for my children. Simple. Ordinary. Extraordinary."
"Nice subtle aroma, fresh and inviting with a taste that is crisp and refreshing with a nice bright carbonation. Not as bitter as some but certainly enough to qualify as a pilsner standard but probably only just. Well balanced and a nice drop. Again, try with mild food."

"I stuck with it to the bitter end though, partly out of morbid curiosity, and partly because of the cast: Sadie LeBlanc plays Lacey’s hairdressing bestie, ‘Stella’ (I’ll admit her hair looks super-cute here), and Sarah Edmondson plays her conspiracy-obsessed lawyer-friend ‘Brooke’… while Lacey’s domineering mother is played by Mary McDonnell, and her younger sister ‘Cherise’ is played by Katharine Isabelle! For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out how old Cherise was supposed to be… I mean, all the female characters behave like high school girls anyway, but Isabelle was in her late twenties at the time, and Lacey keeps treating her like a “kid sister” who needs to be chaperoned at all times! Very strange. Speaking of which, Sarah Strange puts in an appearance as ‘Zoe Manville’, the distraught sister of the victim, and is pretty much the only actress to emerge with a sliver of dignity here."

"Now that you have a firm grasp on the principles of building relationships let us look deeper in to the implementation of those principles on a more short term basis and in regards to sales. Remember that short term relationships can be just as meaningful as long term ones because relationships do not have to be permanent to be effective. I’m not talking about your wild nights at the bar here either although many of these principles are interchangeable in a variety of settings. I am only focused on the short term relationships we build to help us make sales outside of the nightclub setting."

"We wonder why is it the doorkeepers are brought up at this particular point in the historical narrative? Well, you might say, it just so happened to be the case that the king could not sleep and the book of the record of the chronicles was read to the king. Yes this is true. From man’s perspective it was simply a coincidence that the king happened to be reading about the plot of the doorkeepers. But, we know that God works through all things for the good of His elect people. Certainly there must have been volumes of other things that had happened day in and day out in the kingdom and were written down in the chronicles that could have been read to the king that night. Yet God in His perfect orchestration of all things, moved in the small details of even the man turning the pages of that book of records to land upon an account that would capture the king’s interest; and God also moved in the life of the king to perk up his ears to listen carefully at that particular point and to cause him to ask what honor and dignity had been done to Mordecai for this? The book of Esther reveals over and over again that God is sovereign, and that He is in complete control of all things that happen. The name of God is not mentioned in Esther. And no obvious references are even made to Him, but His controlling providential hand is seen repeatedly throughout as things unfold."

He only emphasized the justice of the effort after first emphasizing that it would save the country money (and that many prior presidents had failed to fix the health care system). By the time he got around to defending its moral worth, his opponents had conclusively painted health care reform as a dictatorial power grab. Even though conservative rhetoric about “state socialism” and “death panels” was egregiously untrue, it was still a powerful moral indictment of the president’s (alleged) goals. The president explained that health care reform would work, and his opponents replied that it was unjust. Obama carried the votes and still lost the public debate."

I thought that I'd just leave the jam there, after all who knows what other insects it might prevent from coming in the house--two days ago we had a huge carpenter ant enter the house via the same window that the sugar ants come in.

"Corruption is so satanically widespread, and mismanagement of resources is well recognised in places. Blessed as most African countries are in mineral and human resources, what had worked out to bless other countries, has been a source of stagnation, mischievous selfishness, and backwardness to them. Oil is a good instance. Oil should eliminate poverty and starvation, while opening up opportunities for people to be gainfully employed and be creatively self-sufficient. With oil, infrastructural provisions, educational advancement, social development and even unity should not be a rarity as they are, today. Oil has succeeded in tearing us apart as a people. Massive structural deformations and deaths have since occupied the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria, for instance. Young men and women who should be enjoying the glorious outcomes of oil are into militancy ad deadly combat with government; most of them experience a sense of loss and de-humanization. Because of lack of plans, manipulation and greed, oil has become a malediction, a negative product. African economy is largely consumer-oriented because productivity is not encouraged in most countries. Competitions among people on religious, social and economic grounds have rendered them ignobly violence-prone. We are no producers, but consumers (of what others have produced)."

But now they are hid from thine eyes.

Some kids could keep hoops going round their necks and arms as well as their waist. I had trouble with just the one but it kept us fit!"
"I guess the only real problem I am having with this holiday is that nothing is open, not even the Chinese Restaurants!! What's up with that? But also since money is kind of tight these days (not to mention grocery shopping is a major chore with my car being out of commission lately) we haven't even prepared a regular, non holiday dinner and we have very few options in the pantry!"
"We also had a meeting on Thursday with his doctor, two primary nurses and a social worker to get all our questions answered, and to talk about the plan to get him home. It was a productive meeting, and while (of course!) we don't have an exact plan or timeline (it's really up to Andrew) we know what needs to happen to get him home. The biggest challenge upcoming is eating. Preemies often have problems with remembering to suck/swallow/breath when they take a bottle and can aspirate (swallow fluid into the lungs), brady (heartrate drop) or other issues. We know he is already dealing with reflux, so of course, that can be a problem too. The doctor was hopeful that he was ready to try feeds again."
"* ”employ” is a loose term, which means we’ll probably just buy him lots of beers and let him take pics of us in our underwear."
"The people of Tower Hamlets face a real tyranny. Everything in this borough is being skewed towards the ever increasing empowerment and entrenchment of a radical Muslims. Not only has historic Spitalfields been renamed ""Banglatown"" but there are calls to rename other wards (because Christian names ""offend""), local tube stations and even streets."
"Breathing out slowly, she now felt almost at ease. She just needed to get that damn boy out of her head and then she could get on with her homework."
"Place dough into a well greased bowl and allow to rise until slightly fluffy, about 30 minutes. On a well-floured surface use your hands to flatten and spread out the dough until it's about 3/4 inch thick. Fold the dough in half from top to bottom, then in half again from left to right. Return dough back to to bowl, cover, and let sit until it has risen slightly, about 30 minutes."
"Whereas “Tainted Love” was just shitty!"
"7. Return the logs to the captain, who in turn will give you the rusty old compass, AND offer you a free nautical lesson!"
"Another element that I so love about Screaming for Vengeance is that, while it's immortal in quality, the album is very easily dated to the 80s and influential on so many greats to follow from Europe and the states. The zephyr-like reverb on the instruments, the huge if simple guitar hooks built to fill an arena, this was all a blueprint for hundreds of speed, power and even hard rock acts through the decade, and I really loved this sense of grand production, something we seem to miss in this modern age of excess tracking and digitized over-polish. Not that Screaming for Vengeance isn't 'clean' or mainstream enough sounding to satisfy even the most ardent pop audience, but there's just this sense of glory through the album that I don't get out of Rhapsody or Dragonforce, despite all their advancements in speed and technicality. This is not the best of Priest, but it's very far up the scale, hot enough to burst the mercury from its thermometer."

"Jo Anne and I trust one another a lot. I guess we have too in order for our relation to work for so long and with so much distant between us. When either one of us on out with friends, we tell the other who we are going out with and this includes guys and girls. I have told Jo Anne about all the friends I hung out with or do things with. Jo Anne told me about her friends and I have met some of her guy friends. I trust her because I know when it comes down to it I have her heart. Jo Anne know she has my heart and trust me. We share all kinds of things with one another in order to keep and grow that trust."
"Yet the album was slagged by many critics! Labels such as confused, flawed, awkward, dated, and misogynistic abounded - and those were the good reviews! I always found that last criticism a bit, odd given there were two girls in the band. Whatever! But then the same criticism gets leveled at The White Stripes."

"“I’m surprised you haven’t chosen to pick on the parting of the red sea or on Noah’s ark or any of those events.” I have tackled these issues before, and it gets boring, but are you trying to say that you maybe even don’t believe these things happened? They didn’t, rest assured. If there were a worldwide flood, somewhere in the geological strata there would be proof of it, but there isn’t. If the Red Sea was parted, then there would be proof of thousands of Egyptian soldiers and their horses and chariots washed away in it. Nothing has been found in the Red Sea except something that may or may not be a chariot wheel. Oh, that’s proof of it right there. One object that slightly resembles a wheel is proof that Moses parted the Red Sea, therefore proving God! That’s the ace in the hole for people who try and prove the events of the Exodus."
"I had not anticipated attention. But as soon as I walked in, eyes fell onto me and stayed there. One chubby boy ran up to me and pointed to my face, exclaiming:"
"We mistake our online interactions as intimacy, when they are, in fact, much closer to the fancrush you feel for your favourite celebrity. True networking is a two-way street. What is important is connecting with other people. You have to listen as well as broadcast. Ultimately, which platform you use doesn’t matter. It is a personal choice, like wearing a hat. You have to find the one that fits best — tuque, beret, stetson or bowler. (Mine is a propeller beanie.)"
"It was still a bit icy and with yesterday's rain there was a lot of water coming over the dam. This dam has been here for centuries but there's a movement starting in town to have it removed to make fish passage easier and hopefully restore our anadromous fish run. Studies show there's bedrock just upstream of the dam and without the impediment there would be a nice rapid right through town. Our house is just around the bend upstream, we could literally walk to the end of our street, jump in our kayaks and paddle the three miles out to sea. I told my daughter that I hope we can all do that someday, she smiled."

"Playing as 5 characters instead of 1…actually isn’t as confusing as it would seem. The critters scurry along with one another…so when one moves, they all move. Another thing I like about the gameplay is that you don’t have to move your character(s) to an exact spot. For the most part, they all stay in a little huddle in one spot, and you click on various aspects of the environment to manipulate your surroundings into getting what you want/need (whether it’s an item to trade, a key, or a lost critter you’re helping to find). At times, certain scenarios allow you to click any of the 5 creatures to attempt to complete a task, with only 1 being actually able to do it successfully. It’s a process of trial and error… or logic if you want to call it that, but sometimes the critter that solves it, does so by a completely random, non sensical body movement… so logic isn’t always the case."

"With U.S. cities moving this week to crack down on Occupy Wall Street encampments - including the one in New York's Zuccotti Park - the staying power of the movement is in question.

"In 1837, she was one of the organizers of the Anti-Slavery convention of American Women. The following year, on May 15, the convention met in Philadelphia in the newly constructed Pennsylvania Hall. When the sessions were disturbed by an anti-abolitionist mob, it was Mrs. Mott who exhorted the women to remain calm. During the evening of May 17 the building was set afire & burned to the ground. While the hall was burning, the mob stated toward the Motts’ home on North Ninth Street, where the family sat quietly, awaiting the worst; fortunately the crowd was diverted before reaching the destination."

"I haven’t always had flat feet; but being pregnant tends to make your feet go all out of shape. See, what happens is, when you are pregnant, you have this hormone that causes your ligaments to relax (you’ve gotta be able to get a 6+ lb child through your pelvic girdle, the ligaments stretch). However, this hormone isn’t focused to your pelvic region, it effects EVERY ligament in your body, including the ones that hold your feet together. My feet grew a half size to a whole size with each pregnancy and they don’t shrink back afterwards."

Just as he got her there, he yelled back to me “good call babe!”. Poor Soph, she practically turned inside out that night. Drew had to leave for work at 4 am for a very early morning meeting which meant that neither he nor I got any sleep.

"Or, how about an more troubling thought?: What if the blue light of hope just didn’t work at all? I mean, to be driven to insanity, or villainy, or the deepest evil, one would have to be completely devoid of hope, right? They’d have lost the hope for a peaceful life, or turned their back on hope in favor of some other emotion? (Fear seems to be the inevitable opposite of hope.) In a recent issue of “Green Lantern: New Guardians”, Saint Walker attempts to use the blue light to quell the rage of of Invictus (whom I’m convinced is a white light being) to no avail – in fact, it does nothing but further anger Invictus into spilling his life story in true super-villain fashion. And even on those of a good heart the blue light doesn’t work – I remember when Saint Walker uses the blue light on the Blue Lantern founder Ganthet, in an attempt to relieve his grieving heart for the loss of his love, Sayd. All that did was make him more depressed (though now he is back to being an emotional void like the rest of the Guardians, I wonder if it would trouble him to see Sayd in her current state – being used as a surfboard by Larfleeze)."
"Nate pointed out that a common theme in many articles and features in Kinfolk -and in many of the blogs and magazines we all probably read- seems to feature urbanites escaping from the city to the county to reconnect with nature, reconnect with each other, reconnect with themselves. It's so true that for many of us urban dwellers, the daily grind fantasy lies in the escape to the country. Let's call it Arcadian Escapism. (Guilty as charged.)"

"I believe the first thing to do to move the curve is to look at BWT (birth weight) Estimated Breeding Values (EBVs) from NSIP metrics. When choosing which ewes to retain last fall, I did pay attention to that number, and gave it fairly high priority. I scaled back on using my ram that has the poorest values. I painfully let go of some otherwise very nice ewes because they had lower BWT metrics than average for me. They will do well in someone else’s barn lambing scenario."

Take the time to thoroughly research these traits so that you can make an informed decision. Some breeds shed more than others, while some breeds have known behavioral issues. For example, Great Pyrenees dogs are very beautiful and popular, but they are bred for livestock guarding and not apartment living."

"Once in awhile I like a pizza that is a little less traditional, as in a red tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, and this one fits the bill perfectly. Instead of a tomato sauce, I make a homemade alfredo sauce, and instead of gooping the top with mozzarella, I use the alfredo sauce as sort of a thin layer of cement for the spinach and tomatoes and just garnish with a bit of grated parmesan after it comes out of the oven. I like keeping this vegetarian, but it tastes great with shredded/diced chicken added as well."

"* I feel like that when I teach I will use a lot of both types. I feel like if I had the time I would teach relational understanding and I feel as though for really important topics I will teach this way, however I also feel like with all of the requirements there is no way you can teach like this all of the time and be effective at it. Because of this I feel like I will end up teaching instrumentally most of the time just simply because it will allow me to get through the material faster and help the students understand best in the little amount of time given to cover each topic. However if individual students are confused or there is extra time available I will try to teach using relational understanding."

My iPod started me off with ""Womankind"" by Annie Lennox from The Women soundtrack and really got me moving. The beat is great and very uplifting. I just added it to the mix a couple days ago and it is definitely a winner. I also like the next song from that same soundtrack called ""I Feel It All"" by Feist. It has a great beat but is a little bid subdued so it kept me from bursting out of the gate."

This notion of not wanting the bridesmaids to look better than the bride is utterly ridiculous.

This was about the time I started to sell wholesale in a group on Face Book and I was getting orders like crazy. I was afraid I was in over my head, but I did it and was putting my earnings aside for the trip. Within 2 weeks, I had money for my airfare and made my plane reservation. By mid April I had enough saved up for food. John and Jim made plans to stay at the Gold Coast Casino and Deb had room for me, Diane and Donna in her apartment.

"I want to make it clear though that being a respectful parent doesn't mean agreeing with or approving of everything your teen does: it just means accepting and not attempting to control what they do. Thus a parent that's strongly anti-drugs of all types might share all their opinions on the issue with their teens, give them information on why they believe what they do, etc. Yet despite that, they wouldn't ground, punish, or shame their teen if they came home high. In a mutually respectful relationship, teens are far more likely to genuinely take their parents opinions into account when deciding what they want to do, but teens are still their own complete and autonomous people, and will make the choices they deem best for themselves in the end."

"As for me... well, I have been dealing with ongoing headaches ever since The Bug dropped two FULL Sigg bottles on my head one morning last week. I did see the doctor about it yesterday and she said I check out fine. While the area where the bottles hit my skull is still tender and a tiny bit swollen, the headaches get worse as the day wears on and often envelope the entire right side of my head as well as my neck, which is my old MO for stress headaches. I thought about it yesterday and realized that I do feel very stressed out all day every day lately due to the horrific state of our house. Clutter, clutter EVERYWHERE but it's all I can do to get the bare minimum done every night between the time when the girls go to bed and I do. Our biggest problem is paper clutter and I'm often tempted to just make a big ole bonfire out of all of it."
"But what if the Holy Bible turns out to be true? What if there is a judgment, a Kingdom of Heaven and a Hell? What if? If you are wrong, you have much more to lose than I do if I am wrong. Christ refers to an awful place “where the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched,” a place of “outer darkness,” where there will be “weeping and gnashing of teeth.” I’ve heard people say that there is a great party going on down there, but somehow it doesn’t sound like a good time to me. I have a friend who despises hot weather and I have always been afraid of darkness. I mean really dark darkness. I panic when I can’t see anything. My friend and I would not do well in Hades, if it is as Jesus described it. I have nothing to lose by believing Christ’s teachings. I will hold on to my faith."

"“To my mind the most interesting thing in art is the personality of the artist; and if that is singular, I am willing to excuse a thousand faults. I suppose Velasquez was a better painter than El Greco, but custom stales one’s admiration for him: the Cretan, sensual and tragic, proffers the mystery of his soul like a standing sacrifice. The artist, painter, poet, or musician, by his decoration, sublime or beautiful, satisfies the aesthetic sense; but that is akin to the sexual instinct, and shares its barbarity: he lays before you also the greater gift of himself. To pursue his secret has something of the fascination of a detective story. It is a riddle which shares with the universe the merit of having no answer.”"

The guard claimed that the Afrikaners then had then ‘run away and jumped back into their bakkie’, and that he had gone to the police station to lodge a charge of assault."

"One injustice at the news of this death is that he never received the Nobel nod like his two formidable contemporaries from la Generación del Boom, Gabriel García Márquez from Colombia, and Mario Vargas Llosa from Perú, the latter just two years ago.

"Klaatu manages to enlists Helen's aid, but Tom tells the authorities of the alien's location. Helen and Klaatu take a taxi to wait at Barnhardt's home until the conference. Klaatu tells Helen that if anything should happen to him, she must go to Gort and say, ""Klaatu barada nikto."" When they are spotted, Klaatu tries to flee but is shot dead. Gort awakens, killing two guards before Helen gives Klaatu's message to him. Gort gently carries her into the spaceship, retrieves Klaatu's corpse, and temporarily revives him. Klaatu steps out of the spaceship and addresses the assembled scientists, explaining that humanity's penchant for violence and first steps into space have caused concern among the other space faring worlds, who have created a race of robot enforcers like Gort and given them absolute power to deal with any violence. He warns that the people of Earth can either abandon warfare and peacefully join these other nations or be destroyed, adding that ""The decision rests with you."" He then enters the spaceship and departs."
"Sleep, that is what Sicilians want, and they will always hate anyone who tries to wake them... our sensuality is a hankering for oblivion, our shooting and knifing a hankering for death...The novel is ultimately despairing, I found: the truce, indeed loving friendship, between Angelica and Concetta is founded on a pragmatic repression of the past, but that past is briefly revived and Concetta must face the fact that she has lived with a personal legacy of emptiness echoing the wider political impotence that the novel portrays."
"""For me, it became a pleasure to kill. The first time, it's to please the government. After that, I developed a taste for it. I hunted and caught and killed with real enthusiasm. It was work, but work that I enjoyed. It wasn't like working for the goverment. It was like doing your own true job - like working for myself ... I was very, very excited when I killed. I remember each killing. Yes, I woke every morning excited to go into the bush. It was the hunt."""
"Russell T Davies has consistently written some rather breezy opening stories. They’ve been episodes that I have generally quite enjoyed but been under whelmed by. Anyone else agree? They have been scene setters for the new companion (or in the case of series two the new Doctor). A chance for the Doctor and his companion to meet each other, find they work well together and like each other because they have overcome extraordinary odds. The challenges in their relationship and its subsequent development come in the following episodes as they get to know each other and work together more. This is probably a realistic way of developing each series – that’s what we should expect from Russell T Davies who above all else knows how to write character. But I do gag for something that feels like a proper kick off. Something to make you boggle. Remember the old days? Series openers like Spearhead from Space, The Masque of Mandragora, The Leisure Hive."
"As a stay at home mom, I have occasionally noticed a certain level of patronization and derision aimed my way by the more left-leaning, feminist career women sector. There seems to be a perception that stay at home moms are rich women who are not pulling their weight in society and have taken the easy way out or, even sillier, that those women are victims of male hegemony who have been brainwashed and, poor creatures, simply don't know any better. The reality is far different, but more on that in a minute."
"Last weekend I had the pleasure of hosting a demo for a group of women from Windy Brushes, the IL chapter of the Society of Decorative Painters. Because autumn in IL is such a beautiful and colorful time of year, but also short-lived, I wanted to take advantage of the changing colors in the autumn leaves for the project I was demonstrating. Each student left that day with a set of 4 watercolor cards with matching envelopes. I selected Canson Monvant 140 lb. 5"" x 7""cards, which come with matching envelopes. Below is a tutorial I put together for students who paid for the class, but could not stay. I thought I would share it with you here."

"Mom had never met a stranger, they were all just friends she was not yet acquainted with. Dad had never enjoyed crowds, but tolerated them for Mom's sake. After she died, he was very quick to say, ""I am done now. Goodnight."" and leave. Abruptly. And I think that is how he ended his life, as well."
"Under union bylaws, the secretary-treasurer was allowed to write checks on the union account, but two signatories were required. However, sometime in 2006 or 2007, Hill changed the procedure to allow him to be the sole signatory on the checks, claiming it was too difficult to get two officers’ signatures every time he wanted to write a check, the complaint alleges."
"At best, Thompson asserts, Calvin means by his classification the possibility of “a suspension of the rules, not a change” (4). Thus, there may be occasions when the voice of a woman in church will be called for or at least unavoidable, but these occasions do not permit “a change in polity but a temporary suspension thereof in circumstances of necessity or emergency” (5), a position Calvin is not the first to hold (re. Vermigli)."

"The combination of the copper hood and dramatic tile just seemed to call out for stained cabinets instead of the white ones I usually pick out for my dream kitchen. I like these because they're a little more rustic looking. I would do the top cabinets all with glass fronts to lighten things up a bit (and paint the backs creamy white or mustard-y yellow - not sure) and they would go alllllllll they way to the ceiling with a very, very simple moulding at the top. Very simple hardware as well, probably oiled bronze or black to blend in with the wood."
"Perhaps she is attempting to mold him into something “properly orcish” rather than any attempt to get him to embrace “what he truly is.” To her, that is “Go’el.” A Mag’har orc of the traditional style. if so, does she love what Thrall is, right now, or does she love an idea of what she’d like him to be? Who is she to say what he truly is? Nothing is written anywhere. There is no decree by his people or his parents that he must not be Warchief and instead be a shaman, or that he must be this Go’el and not Thrall."

"I will begin this by saying that I enjoy dressing up and looking nice. In fact, I think it would be nice if people took a little bit of extra time to look nice, instead of ""cool"". Sure, I wear blue jeans and t-shirts as much as the next person, but I still appreciate the early part of the last century where everyone - literally everyone - dressed up at all times. Men wore suits in every situation and women wore dresses."

"However, I think increasing worker power through the empowering of unions is probably the most crucial and indispensable step. The experience of the British Labour Party during the Blair and Brown years have shown that without counter-acting the “undertow” of neoliberal political economy, income transfers are extremely limited in their effectiveness. A combination of direct job creation in order to counter-effect this undertow and labor law reform to give unions space to run is needed to allow income transfers to live up to their potential."
"When I made the decision to leave K for the academic advising job across the street, that meant moving out of the on-campus apartment. The great thing about working in Residential Life is that it is field-standard to provide Hall Directors (or, in my case, Area Coordinators) with a furnished apartment and meal plan as part of their compensation package. Not having to buy a ton of furniture right out of grad school (and incur more debt on top of school loans) was awesome. One of my goals was to gradually transition my own furniture into the apartment (some inherited furniture from family and some bought on my own) and have the College put theirs in storage so that when I did eventually move out – I wouldn’t have to buy everything in the world at once."

"This film, in my opinion and terms, is an achievement for Hindi cinema, not because people think that the subject is brave, but it is an achievement for what it tries to capture, and those are, sentiments, pure, negligent and meticulous. When energy strikes something cold, liveliness is felt. For an old man whose feelings are long lost, all that remains are memories, which could be looked back, again and again."

Truth is, homeschooling is hard work."
"In the meantime, I wanted to let everyone know that Copic is accepting applications for the intermediate program. I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the first one in Chicago with the other Copic educators this past fall.

To be able to give your images dimension it's important to think about light, shadow and have a greater understanding of color theory--all of which are discussed in the intermediate class."
"The nurse was nice enough, that is until she gave me a strep throat test. Have you ever had a strep throat test before? If not, I'll give you a quick little run down... first they take the tongue supressor (aka a giant popsicle stick) and force your tongue down as they tell you to say ""Ahhhhhhhh."" Then, while you're distracted, they sneakily take out a giant stick with a Q-tip at the end and jab it at the back of your throat. repeatedly. for fun."
"Then there are all the slightly older kids repeating the patterns of their parents. Getting pregnant outside of marriage, having abortions, etc, etc. That is a vast sea as well. Then there is this new sea of need...the frozen embryos. These lives just freshly knit together sitting somewhere waiting for a stomach to grow it. Sitting there because so many couples who could have adopted, couples who wanted a little baby to love and hold; wanted a baby to love and hold that looked just like them. They didn't want to go get one of these millions of other little ones who needed to be held and rocked. So they turned to science and medicine. And now there are too many of them. Science couldn't do it just right so now there are too many embryos for that couple. They just want one or two. Oh, how sad it is."
"After racially abusing BBC’s Johah Fisher in April, 2010, after Fisher remarked that Malema lives in an affluent suburb of Johannesburg, Malema was unapologetic about his actions. He accused Fisher of being disrespectful and of coming from a country that undermines the credibility and integrity of African leaders. But Malema’s narcissism is most evident in his insistence that Fisher apologise after the incident, despite the fact that the ANC and President Jacob Zuma condemned Malema’s outburst."

"As we gathered by the bus at 6:15am, a student turned to my husband and asked, incredulously, “You ski?

"The music that I write now has always been there. In fact, I met the Loro's members while I was first starting the whole Pika thing, but I put it on the backburner because I loved my members and wanted to devote all my time to working and fine-tuning music with Loro's. I have no real super huge goal with Pika and I hope that it makes a few people very content and that would just make my day. In fact, it's more like a project that I do on my own because sometimes a girl just has to sing to herself, because you yourself are the only one that really knows you, right??? hehe. In any case, I haven't really hyped it up that much or anything because it was more my own naked music, fetal position, happy, sad, what have you. I'd like it to hopefully become more easier to do concerts (this recent concert was quite stressful)."

It’ll be different, just like a bowl of soup, coffee and cobbler at home is not the same as eating around the campfire while stretching out sore muscles from sleeping on the ground all night. Dreamville offers more than road food, Jess offers good food that makes the road something to remember. There’s not a lot on the lunch menu…. But there shouldn’t. It should be And it is. One could argue that offering a ‘main entree menu’ with 14 pages of desserts, entrees, and side dishes hides the fact that the food is ‘So-So’ at best. My experience would prove that to be true. Check out the menu selection on line (see at bottom). While you might think you want more, think quality over quantity. If you think that everything on the dessert menu online will be there, think again. You might want to call ahead to see if she can make something special for you, or maybe just to see if she isn’t sold out (I have to go back for the cherry turnovers and rumor has it the apple turnovers sell out even faster!)

I have trouble when closing the SSSR of pulling the loop thread so tight that a space opens up between that SSSR and the one previous to it. I did figure out one trick, when you have finished the first half of the SSSR, and lay the shuttle over your hand to pull the loop out to tat the 2nd half, put the shuttle through the SSSR and then over your hand, that way, the shuttle thread come out on the back of your SSSR. for me that made it easier to get the next ring snugged down very close. I figured that out about 5 rings in, you can see the rest of the SSSRs are closer together then the ones at the beginning of the tail."

"In fashioning a reason to like having kids, it was tempting to group these moments under a label like ‘innocence’ or ‘purity’ or ‘simplicity’ and to pose them against the exhaustion, stress, cynicism, manipulation, and jealousy of adulthood. But this opposition is fanciful and unfair to both children and adults. My children are not naïve actors in the world. They have their demands. They have their desires. They have their strategies to pursue them. In this, they are not pure, innocent, or simple. Similarly, as an adult I don’t find my life to be defined in world-weary terms. Adulthood is so much more complicated and interesting than that."

"Bennett: The DTFH Fest was a really cool experience. It was awesome to share the stage with some our friends who are also in bands, like the guys from Hold Tight! I think the greatest part of the whole thing was just seeing what is basically started as an online DIY community come together for a weekend. All for the sake of kick-ass music and fun hangs. I did get a chance to catch a few bands while I was there. I got to see Spraynard for the first time, and they fucking killed it! Our friends in Hold Tight(free download) played a real killer set as well. Got to meet some friendly Canadians in a band called Brutal Youth who drove 16 hours from Canada to play the show!

"46. Famous names from Scottish literature include: Sir Walter Scott,Lord Byron and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle."
"But honestly, I think I get such satisfaction from things like this specifically because I do them for no other reason than my own free will. Making a fire when you have a perfectly good heating system is fun simply because it's optional. It's an extra that I do just because I feel like it, and because looking at that little fire chugging along is reassuring. The wood fire is there because I willed it to be. Clearly, it's a sharp contrast to the way my mornings run otherwise, and it's a needed difference that actually reduces my stress. The bulk of time between waking and getting Ada off to school is mostly about doing things not because I feel like it, but because they just need to be done. Starting a day with lighting the stove is like putting a capital at the start of a declarative sentence: I still exist as something outside of the routine; I retain my free will."
"The ""debunking"" of cold fusion, aka LENR, aka quantum fusion, was largely based on scientific fraud committed at MIT in 1989. This is the allegation of the head of MIT's science information office at the time, the late Dr. Eugene Mallove. He alleges this fraud was perpetrated to ensure that MIT continued to receive tens of millions of dollars for its thermonuclear fusion program (""hot fusion""). The report containing this allegation is quite long but the documentation to support the charge is extensive and well worth the read."

This one is a 1954 RCA Estate electric range and oven. Actually it has three ovens. The range top has two large burners and two small ones, and in the center it has a griddle with a super large burner beneath it. It's 40"" wide so there is much more room for canners and pots. And I have plenty of room for it in my canning kitchen. I'll let you know if we buy it."

"By the way, check Deathspell Omega’s “Veritas Diaboli Manet in Aeternum: Chaining the Katechon”. It’s 22 minutes long, it’s only one track but, artistically-wise, it’s far more dense, solid and intense, than most of the so-called “albums” that are, for the most part, a “collection of tracks recorded during the same session”. Releasing a track each month or twelve a year makes no difference, in my opinion, if the artist is all about “songs” the “usual way”: that’s “just” the “way the band is sounding at a given time”."

"I had never seen anyone, either in the neighborhood Olympics or the real ones on television, move as fast as that tiny little woman who gave birth to us did when she put it together. And the things she said… My God, I was awestruck. It was a veritable flurry of threats that even in my youth I found puzzlingly hypocritical. If my mother was so terribly concerned that I might possibly maim or kill my little brother, why on earth would she then proceed to threaten similar consequences if I didn’t get him, to use her words, “out of that damned wagon safely right this very minute”?"

"Povitica, pronounced ‘po-va-teet-sa’ is traditional Eastern European dessert bread that is traditionally served during the holiday season. It is also known as Nutroll, Potica, Kalachi or Strudia. It is a heavy sweet bread that requires quite a bit of time, skill and patience to make, meaning they often sell for extortionate amounts. Povitica is quite unique and unlike any other kind of bread I’ve ever come across. It looks a little rustic on the outside, but once sliced, reveals the most amazing swirls of thin dough interlaced with sweet sticky filling. I love how its not even just one swirl, but two or three individual swirls in each slice. It really is quite extraordinary, a real show stopper!"

His laughter and joy were ever contagious and he would make the most of any situation. He would enter the bar and his jolly laugh would light up even the coldest hearts. His big bear hugs and lifts could mend your aching soul. His ability to intimidate the unitimidated was epic, and you always knew he was there to have your back. My life will be a little darker without him around. You never knew what to expect to come out of his mouth as his sense of humor was one of a kind. He will forever be missed and forever we will look to the right, or exactly .9 miles, to see his silhouette at another bar's front step. Who will yell out to guests,"" Welcome to (can't put bars name here because I signed a paper.)"" He is preceded in leaving by many countless yellow shirts and has left his cousin, Dalton, behind to carry on the legacy.

"One of the more restrained and interesting riffs on the Post-Modernism of the 1980s, a mix of allusion and illusion, modern with the seeming old, David Whitcomb's four pavilions connected to a long hall, an eighty-five-foot-long spine, set high on a ridge overlooking the Hudson River was, I thought at the time, one of the most exciting houses published in the 1980s. I still find it interesting but, to be honest, not quite as exciting as it once was."
"The second problem according to Prof. Desiraju is the method of appointments followed by state universities. In his words: “In the more influential central institutions, appointments are often made incestuously, with students of a few senior researchers filling a disproportionately large number of vacancies, or with plain academic 'inbreeding'. A good dose of regional parochialism completes the picture.”"

I would argue that the ripples caused by Rosa Parks when she sat on the “wrong” part of the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 1, 1955 ultimately led to the over-throw of aparteid in South Africa in 1994 – almost 40 years later. Certainly, for Ireland, the Civil Rights movement in the US led to The Contraceptive Train in May 1971, when women travelled by train to Belfast to buy contraceptives and smuggle them into the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland."

"I know my kids are healing, and trusting more. I know they consider that ladder I have for them more often, than completely rejecting it. I can’t imagine how desperately vulnerable it has to be for them to even consider letting go of what has kept them alive."

"The poor dollar seems to take a beating wherever it goes. Many Americans are letting their European cousins visit them this year. Others are dusting off their campers. But there is good news. In Vietnam, the dollar’s value has increased over the last year. In fact, with an exchange rate of around 18,435 dong to the dollar, a $100 bill can make you an instant millionaire. The even better news is that it is an economical place to travel."

"Grayling says the DWP is committed to implementing improvements “to try to make this a better and fairer process”. He adds: “The only alternative to this is to leave people on benefits for the rest of their lives, doing nothing.” Farmer stresses that Mind is also in favour of helping people into work. “We are very strong believers in the idea that people with mental health problems can and should work where that is possible … but we also know that there are huge barriers to finding work,” he says."

"Come the day, he arrives at the venue with Ga Young and Designer Kim. It is a fashion show for GG, Young Gul’s new venture. Jae Hyuk frowns at the designs. Finally at the end, Young Gul walks on stage. He and Ga Young catch each other’s eyes before he turns back and beckons Anna on stage. When Anna does come up, stumping Jae Hyuk and Ga Young, you can see the gloat in Young Gul’s expression. (Could it be any crazier?) Jae Hyuk watches Ga Young tear up and takes her hand, the gesture not lost on both Young Gul and Anna. Ga Young doesn’t take her hand back and turns to look at Young Gul, who is likewise looking at her in anger."

"The sweetcorn has been sown, and the little strawberry plants put in the strawberry planter… I may have to cover them tonight, as I think there may be some frosts. I have been reading about strawberries, and it would seem that I am to pick off many of the flowers in order to get a better crop. It seems beastly, but I may make myself tomorrow!"
"I love magazines. I really do. But I realize that magazine exist to sell us stuff. That article in Family Circle about cleaning your kitchen in five minutes is always surrounded by ads for products. Fashion magazines are entirely devoted to making women think that the perfectly good clothes in their closet are out of style. I still like them. Do students understand how much is being sold to them? I'm not sure. This is a nice, short book that covers a lot of different ways this type of media tries to sway readers. This would be a good book to use in a class on media literacy."

"We were right on time for our 1:00 tour, and after two superbly fresh glasses of Steam and a short pleasant visit with Fritz Maytag, walked into the brewhouse, where a batch of 2007 Christmas Ale was in the mash tun (and right up to the brim of the mash tun, too). We checked out the shallow lager/steam tanks (where we were told that only the Steam was brewed with a lager yeast; all the other beers were done with the same ale yeast), the open ale ferment tanks, the big closed tanks used for conditioning, and then to the bottling line, where I found this six-pack of just-packed 2007 Christmas Ale (sorry: didn't get a taste, it was embargoed until Nov. 5)."

"The enterprise went on to become the largest distillery in the young nation, and operated even after Washington's death in 1799 -- until it burned to the ground in 1814, becoming forgotten for two centuries, until its foundation was uncovered in a 2000 archaeological dig."
"It seemed all of nature was heralding spring today. I saw the first oystercatcher. He is a couple of weeks early I think. The songbirds were boisterous all day and all the summer birds will show up soon. I took advantage of the balmy weather and sat outside this evening absorbing the smells of spring, the songs of the pinkletinks, and the low moan of the fog horn."

A park with housing is simply someone's nice backyard. We want to see a park that is the equal and open backyard for ALL of Brooklyn."

"Beer, once again, is being used as the scapegoat. No doubt it makes sense to some, when we see that the biggest rises are among poor people, especially men, especially in deprived parts of the north, and the media stereotype of beer drinkers remains that of the northern working class male. But this stereotype is inaccurate, as I've pointed out many times before."

"Had the government chosen to bail out Borders there would have been a public outcry. Why should we protect the jobs of those store shelf stockers? Likewise, as the number of printed books drops, replaced by digital books, should it be government policy to subsidize book (or magazine, or newspaper) publishers/printers? Whenever a business is no longer competitively productive – whether it be agricultural, manufacturing or anything else – bailouts serve only to keep the unproducctive competitor alive. Which actually harms the more competitive company that subsequently must fight the subsidized competitor…."
"Not only do we get the return of the Monk, but we also get the most unlikely returning race- the Vardans! Cornell does a great job of giving the Vardans some background, history and character. We are also treated to a female Chronovore. The climax of the book echoes The Time Monster, with the Chronovore capturing the Monk to be tormented for eternity. Evidently he escaped, as he has recently reappeared in the Big Finish audios."

"It's bad enough when a customer stiffs you on a tip for a round or two, but what if a customer repeatedly stiffs you on every single round that they order? How I handle the situation all depends on the bar I am working at. Sometimes bars and restaurants have a strict policy about customer service. They fumble over themselves doing whatever it takes to make the customer happy. That means that when a customer doesn't tip, there isn't much you can do or say. You just have to accept it and hope that the next customer does tip."
"On February 21st, Steve Milloy of JunkScience.com, was published in The Washington Times in an opinion about EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson’s testimony before Congress writing that “Over the past three years, the Obama EPA has conducted a scorched earth campaign against fossil fuel producers and users, especially the coal-fired power industry, with multibillion-dollar rules that provide no meaningful environmental or public health benefits.”"

"Absolutely yes. “I see it all the time,” says Russell Goodwin of Impact Solutions in Beachwood, Ohio. In the beginning there is going to be a significant lack of trust because there have been lots of broken promises, hurt feelings, and deceptions. It’s important to first have some basis in recovery before beginning the process of repairing relationships. Each member of the relationship needs to be doing their own individual work before proceeding to work on their relationship. Once you are established in your own work/recovery, you can start work on healthy communication and honesty with each other."
"Narrowing his eyes, DJ considered the reporter, “Navy man?”"

"Moreover, I think this will soon become a reality, because organizations need to reach prospective customers where they interact with each other, and for the most part, I would say this interaction is continually growing on social media platforms. I also don’t see the trend changing in the near future, so prepare for the social media landscape to be somewhat constantly present."

"Background information: In April we were still in Toronto, Canada with our daughter and needed to bring the cats back across the border into the United States. This was quite an easy accomplishment in the end and even though I had tons of paperwork with me, the border guards barely looked at the cats and waved us through. I had taken the cats to the vet and gotten a checkup for them and rabies shots. Turns out, it was harder to get the car back into the U.S. than it was the cats."
"The only way I can read this story and make Jesus’ behavior make any sense is to see it as a possible teaching moment for those who were listening. I think this way based on Jesus’ openness to healing those outside the Jewish faith. He didn’t hesitate to heal the Centurians child, or Legion. In John 4, it states that Jesus “HAD” to go through Sammaria, which resulted in his encounter with the woman at the well, when clearly that wasn’t the best way to travel. So it would make no sense that all of a sudden Jesus had nothing to offer this woman."

"I just handed mine to the officer at the counter, he just looked at it - most likely at the date of the passport, without being asked any further. I guess, renewing it saved me from questioning. Haha. He then simply grabbed out a payment receipt written on it the date of collection which was actually on a Thursday but I decided to collect it on a Friday instead, figured it as a better timing to clear the week."

"I had to purchase a separate ticket for the special reunion, as I was a huge fan of Star Trek: TNG, as I grew up watching them when it first aired waaay back in 1987 – 1994. Wow, I have nostalgic memories of each of these characters on the show. Not all episodes were great, but you know, there were many outstanding well-written ones that I can still remember clearly to this day."
"This is the infamous Chevy Impala of this poem, New Red Car, this poem, Wheels and the post, Drive, He Said. She looks a bit mean in this photo with that gaping maw in the front, but she could “turn on a dime” and driving her was as smooth as paddling a canoe on a calm river."
"Philip Stein is a Swiss luxury watch brand. There are many Swiss watch makers, each with their own special flare and panache, and figuring out which one is right for you can get confusing. If you’re buying a watch as a gift, for a man, there are some unique considerations."

"In addition to using drones for surveillance and intelligence purposes, increasingly the U.S. military and the C.I.A. are using drones controlled via satellite communication to launch missiles and bombs on population centres indiscriminately, often at distances of many thousands of miles. The outcomes of these terror strikes are countless massacres of innocent civilians. These atrocities are ignored by the capitalist media and major Western “humanitarian” organisations that provide a formidable cover-up for U.S. crimes."

"It is unmistakably Brautigan. And I’ll be honest a little Brautigan can go a long way; he is like Beckett in that respect. His style is laconic, repetitive and expressed in the simple, straightforward language that poor people living on Welfare in any one of a thousand small towns will use happily turning nouns into verbs whenever it suits their needs. The setting in this book is a succession of dreary towns in Oregon but you could shift the action to Louisiana or South Dakota and not bat an eye."
"We pass a military train loaded with soldiers and military equipment. We are now only 150 k from the Pakistan border. We arrive at Jaisalmer. It has been raining. We load our bags into bajajs and drive to the Jaisalmer Fort. Our hotel, the Deepak Rest House, is located within the fort. I have a room to myself. Lunch on the roof-top restaurant. At 1500 we meet for an orientation walk around the narrow streets avoiding motor bikes. Beautiful vistas of the valley below and beyond into the desert."
"Before I get into talking about this too much, I should make a few things clear. First, I am an agnostic by personal definition, atheist by technicality in that there is no god I worship. I prefer the term agnostic, though, since it is my contention that no one can or does know of the existence of anything beyond this mortal coil. I’m also of the opinion that any religion in existence or that has existed simply hasn’t gotten it right. All of this is really neither here nor there, but I also understand that my beliefs, or more accurately my lack of same, could well color the following paragraphs. It’s only fair to get that out in the open."
"She uses one of her Dark Psychological Arts masterfully. This, of course, is the “If you REALLY loved me..” tactic."
"I also added a skull-and-chain combo to the reactor on the back of the model. I didn’t use any dragon heads as muzzles for the exhaust pipes this time around, since that would probably have looked a little silly with four pipes in place. As a final touch, I used a leftover skeleton head as a head for the Dread pilot. I made sure to use a head that looked properly damaged and disfigured. I like the idea that you’ll be able to take of the larger skull mask to look at the Marine’s “true” face underneath."
"The Pain of Silence (vv. 1-3): David begins this psalm in silence. He desires to talk, but is holding back. He is “muzzling” his mouth. The reason David is remaining silent is a noble one: He does not want to voice his thoughts before the “wicked” (v. 1). He fears that speaking will bring indignity to God’s name. Oftentimes silence is a wise course of action before both God (Hab. 2:20; Lev. 10:3) and men (Prov. 17:28; Job 2:13). However, silence can also be sinful (Ps. 32:3; Hab. 1:13), and, as Psalm 39 reveals, harmful. David’s silence only makes his anguish worse (v. 2). His soul is in turmoil, is boiling over, until he finally gives way to speech (v. 3). Like the prophet Jeremiah, David can no longer keep silent regarding the fire in his bones (Jer. 20:9)."
"ME: Um, YEEEESSS. I can TOTALLY sing opera."
"definition 3. Okay — now we’re talking, and not about the “famous” French cuisine (though the food certainly fits with this one, as well). Let me repeat this definition — strikingly, excitingly, or mysteriously different or unusual. If I apply this definition to this place, I would have to say that I couldn’t say it any better — it describes perfectly the environment that surrounds me. Because I cannot say things as simply as Mr. Webster, I will devote much more time and effort to describe this place that is far from south Santa Monica, the place where I cut my teeth on a surfboard. But first…"
"Then, all at once, through all the music, through all the sensible sounds of men building, attempting, comes the Dies Irae."
"The Ockermans are a very special family. I met Georgia and her daughter Katie on a mission trip to Brazil in 2000. In November of that same year, Katie was killed in a car accident. Adam and I flew to San Antonio for the funeral. I saw Georgia again in 2002 and 2004 on two week campaigns to Brazil. Our friendship continued to grow. When I interned, I spent a lot of time at the Ockerman house with Georgia, Jacob, Joel, and Emily. I considered them my second family and lots of people thought I looked like them. Georgia was always so friendly and made me feel at home the moment I arrived in San Antonio. She was always there to listen and willing to help in any way. I am so thankful for the friendship I have with her and her kids. I was sad that Jacob and Joel were not there."

"When I first saw it, the online market that was on that day had only been going for an hour or so at that point. When I saw it I instantly got the feeling that it was meant to be mine. I didn’t have the money though and so I commented saying that although I loved it, I couldn’t afford it at that time. About twenty minutes later I showed it to my parents telling them that I loved it, but couldn’t afford it. That very quickly lead to the suggestion of it being for my birthday and although she didn’t like to do lay-bys, Karen agreed that if no one else claimed it by the end of the day, then she would let me pay that way. Given that there was still about six hours to go before the end of the market, I thought for sure that someone would step in and say sold. But no one did."

When I do finally get up the courage to write about said topics, I feel as though I’m bleeding across the page, the computer screen, so to speak. At the same time, I need an outlet for my feelings on these subjects, as difficult as it may be. I need to express myself. By now you may be asking yourself what topics I am referring to above. They include, but are not limited to:"

"I’m a Milwaukee Brewers fan, which is probably no secret by now. I liked them when they were awful, and I’ll like them when they’re awful again. A few years back I took my foam finger and shared it with the Bronze Fonz in downtown Milwaukee, because I’m sure he’s a fan, too:"
"I went back with my family a little while later, and that time, I tried the “Pizza del Papa” — the “Pope’s Pizza”. It’s made with butternut squash, zucchini, roasted peppers, smoked mozzarella, basil and olive oil. This pizza (which is not fried) was also very good. The butternut squash lent a creamy texture to the pizza, and the zucchini — which was really small — added some nice color and flavor. Who knew that the Pope liked a vegetarian pizza? (No picture, sorry.)"
"It is really hard to focus on the details when your whole atmosphere is alive with the collective voice of God. But I am a trooper (smile.) This heavenly sound was being sung all around her, but there seemed to be… hmmmmmm… geez, words, ya know? I want to say a purpose, but that is so not the right word. The sound was so encompassing around her and seemed to have movement… I noticed there was this interesting wispy like, soft white vortex that was surrounding the ladder her body was standing on. This vortex energy was housed very close to the ladder itself, maybe a space of a foot was between the ladder itself and the wispy vortex."
"I won’t do what they want, obviously. But it is more than a little troubling just how far these criminals will go and just how powerless people like the CIA’s OIG, the Justice Department, and the Administration are to pull these people into line. If that’s not it, then it must be ordered. Which is it? I still think the former, but there comes a point when you have to wonder why it continues unabated."
"And so I started to examine what core mis-Belief(s) I hold about mySelf. I mean, Mr. Carrey seems like a darn-talented guy (have you seen Man on the Moon? or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? The Truman Show? He’s brilliant!) so I think his opinion may have relevance in terms of how characters (identities) are formed. Knowing that each area of my life is a “character” I play, especially roles of “Doctor”, “Partner”, “Yoga Teacher”, and “Artist”, I started delving into the motivating mis-belief that gives life to each of these roles. It’s not as scary as I thought it might be. I thought my world might come falling apart…but it didn’t. As often happens with work like this, progress is made in quiet softenings, unfoldings of movement patterns, bursts of tears and cups of tea with journal entries."
"Air is an intriguing read that held my interest most of the way, even though, as I noted before, I could sense that the air (no pun intended) was let out of it toward the end. The comic's art is good when dealing with people, but in the flight scenes the series could have used an artist more able to suggest a feeling of 'soaring' and the wonder that exists in the sky. Still, Air was, for the most part, an enjoyable read – and a reasonably generous one, at 28 issues collected into four trade paperbacks."

"The real treat of the night was a 1987 bottle of Thomas Hardys Ale. This was from the old Eldridge Pope vintages. It was superb. Described as "" a waltz on the palate,"" it still held loads of sweet fruit flavors with creamy butterscotch notes.

"And I’m constantly searching out new ones (don’t tell my husband — who did take calculus and trig) and I spend far too much time playing games, which require analyzing angles, balance, sweet spots, swing, timing and torque, among other things, in order to collide, cut, destroy or dynamite the objective."
"Mr. Cayabyab propelled his then amateur career through a song writing competition—the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (MetroPop) where his composition Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika won the top prize in the first run of the contest. Freddie Aguilar’s Anak failed to win any awards at that time but went on to become one of the country’s most popular songs. Other hits from the same music festival include Hahanapin ko and Minsan Pa by Jose Mari Chan, Narito Ako and Isang mundo, isang awit by Nonong Pedero, Salamat, salamat Musika by Gary Granada, Ako ang Nasawi, ako ang nagwagi by George Canseco, Ewan by Louie Ocampo, Bulag, Pipi, at Bingi by Snaffu Rigor."

"It was slow going to begin with and I don’t hold anything against you if you bailed early on, but it’s time to come back into the fold because the second half of Community’s season has been nothing short of fantastic. Community has been rattling around in my head almost daring me to define it. If I had to grab a couple of comparisons out of the air and slap them as labels on Community I’d go with The Simpsons and Spaced. Just as with Spaced, Community throws a ragtag team of stereotypes together but elevates them beyond their obvious stereotypes. Both shows like to play around with their character types while continuously stretching them."

"In the LCWR 2001 annual report, Sister Mary Mollisson, CSA, LCWR president, reiterated the long-held conference strategy to keep “dialoging” with Church authorities to keep the issues open. She wrote: “In keeping with our desire for right relationships among church officials and members of the Conference, the Presidency continues a dialogue with bishops and Vatican officials. We approach this dialogue with a sense of urgency and with a passion to stay in conversations that will decrease the tension between doctrinal adherence and the pastoral needs of marginalized people. We also continue to express our desire for women to be involved in more decision-making within church structures. The risk of this part of our journey is being misunderstood and being perceived as unfaithful to the Magisterium of the church.” And she characterized Church officials as just not comprehending the sisters’ message: “Understanding of authority, obedience, communal discernment, and the prophetic nature of religious need further conversations.”"
"The figure is excellent though as all the figures in this series were. It takes the simple 2D design of the South Park characters and flawlessly brings them into the 3rd dimension. They got the crazy hair right, the mis-buttoned shirt is there, what more do you need from a Tweak figure. It is a shame though that so few figures were produced in this line and Tweak had to take up one of the spots, I’d rather of had a Craig. Oh well. 5 out of 10."
"Lovingly dedicated to one of the greatest cats of all time, Maurice. He was named after the old Steve Miller song, wherein Some people call me Maurice/Cause I speak of the pompitous of love.

I owned Maurice at the time the song came out, and used to sing it to him. (He knew the song was all about him.)"

"I don’t know when we started calling the noontime meal in Acadiana lunch. I guess lunch is what you eat when you live by a clock, “we have one hour to grab lunch.” Dinner at my grandparent’s house was an event, often with visitors, boisterous laughter and long conversations, with no one looking at their wrist watch to see how much time was left till work started again. Coffee was served after dinner and as the conversations wound down, my grandfather would always head off for his nap."

"For my brothers and sisters in Christ's remnant wherever you may be .. let us not be faint during these trying times but remember that His grace is sufficient and He will not leave us. These trials will strengthen us and test our faith so as to refine us according to His will. Let us each strive to cast off what is dross, take note of the lateness of hour and be in prayer for one another always. This abomination of man must fall and His kingdom will prevail. His promises are assured and His coming at hand. May we all be found faithful and joyous at heart at His return. Amen."

Here, The Mill is smart enough to understand why many believe that M-theory unites all five string theories and perhaps supplants them; Carinthian Blondvieh cows give lectures on the significance of repetition in Eugène Ionesco’s classic piece of absurdist theatre, La Cantatrice Chauve; and Steven Gerrard plays tiki-taka. As regular readers who “enjoy” this column will have surmised long ago, this experience in the spurious is indeed the main reason The Mill is here early in the morning tapping out all the latest goings-on in the world of football transfers and with that, we are off to Manchester."

"The stigma also surrounds mental health illness too and that HAS to be stopped! Those who are suffering from the various types of mental health illnesses, depression being one of them and almost always associated with suicide, are afraid to reach out for the very help they need. They are fearful of being judged, of being labelled, embarrassment is often felt and yet if they had cancer or any other disease – and believe me – mental health illness is a disease!, they wouldn’t experience that at all. They’d receive understanding, compassion, empathy and support."
"As you set out for Ithaca hope your road is a long one, full of adventure, full of discovery.

"Deja Vu is the intense, awesome experience of knowing exactly how a situation will play out because you’ve been there before. No, I don’t mean when a situation seems “familiar”, and I especially don’t mean when you point out something is happening over and over again. Fuck, that’s the opposite of deja vu. The few times I’ve been lucky enough to experience intense deja vu it felt as though I’d been transported into my own body in the past. I didn’t feel familiar with the situation I was in, I felt as though I could finish every sentence spoken. And the sense of time is amazing, you get a very distinct sensation of not living the same thing twice, but of being in a place you were before, some vague moment a week or a month or a year ago that has dragged you back into itself. In fact, the fullness of sensation experienced has caused quite a few researchers to recommend the term “deja vecu”, because “vu” means “see” but you do more than see. This is evidence that researchers enjoy being pedants when they’ve run out of useful things to do. The point is: I really cannot recommend intense bouts of deja vu enough, they’re lovely."

"When my biological Ascension Process started in February 1999, my body reacted to the 1999 (and later) solar energies with those lovely “Ascension Flu” symptoms; body and bone aches, chills, headache, and the occasional sudden stabbing ice pick-like pains in certain bones for a couple of seconds that literally took your breath away. From the mid-1990s on I’ve been periodically incapacitated by solar energies (solar flares, CMEs etc.) and was forced to rest and/or nap if I could while I had chills, severe body and bone aches and pains, and numerous other ascension symptoms. Over the years these solar triggered ascension symptoms have lessened and become more easily dealt with, not because the energies being transmitted have lessened since 1999 because they’ve steadily increased, but it’s the way they affect our bodies and why that’s changed."

"It is laid out in such a way as to connect with the reader and is written in a style that anyone can understand and follow. This is a feat only rarely achieved by authors who write something as intelligent as this is. Vandenburg does not just stop when he says that everything is a personal choice; he goes very deep into his own mind about it. It was very clear in reading this book that the author has spent a great deal of time actually conceptualizing what would be in this book and putting it into words. Still, he manages to piece his arguments together without rambling or losing the central point of them."

Scrapping is my form of relaxation after a busy day. I love the creative process --- choosing papers, looking for the right embellishments, thinking of my journaling. I am SOO addicted that I think of journaling and layouts in the shower, while breastfeeding, before sleeping, while changing diapers, while cooking, and in almost every spare time I have. I scrapbook because it is how I am able to express my love for my husband and children. I scrapbook because I am a storyteller and I love telling the stories of my children."

The Wheelers and the Jones families were also attacked by Cheyenne warriors. They managed to repulse the attack, but Jacob ended up seriously wounded by an arrow in his chest. The surviving emigrants tried to move on with a wounded Jacob, but the juts and bumps of the trail made it impossible for him to endure the pain. Instead, he insisted that Thunder Heart Woman, Jethro, Mr. Jones and the children continue west to California without him, since he would only prevent them from crossing the Sierra Nevada Mountains before winter. They left him behind with great reluctance."

Going to church has also reminded us often to get our eyes off of ourselves and onto God. EVERY time we quit looking at ourselves we see God do amazing things in our marriage."
"“For almost as long as our nation has existed, man has gazed upon a map of the eastern United States and dreamed of traveling to Cleveland, the largest metropolitan area in Ohio,” NASA administrator Charles F.

"So who is dead in the Joseon era? They never showed her face and there’s obviously some massive cover up going on. I would think the Crown Prince would have identified her corpse by her face and not just her clothing but if there’s a twist in this at all, it would be that the Crown Princess murdered her sister out of jealousy and will pretend to be her by wearing the veil and will later make the Prince fall in love with her as she impersonates her sister . Yes, this is a convoluted theory because why not just kill the younger sister and live on as herself? I did say if. Or maybe Crown Prince will return, take off the veil and see what his sister-in-law really looks like but that would mean Park Ha ends up alone. So for the sake of my sanity, they need to make it so that both their doppelgangers are dead so they can be together in whichever era they choose."

"The genetic characterization of Native Mexicans is important to understand multiethnic based features influencing the medical genetics of present Mexican populations, as well as to the reconstruct the peopling of the Americas. We describe the Y-chromosome genetic diversity of 197 Native Mexicans from 11 populations and 1,044 individuals from 44 Native American populations after combining with publicly available data. We found extensive heterogeneity among Native Mexican populations and ample segregation of Q-M242* (46%) and Q-M3 (54%) haplogroups within Mexico. The northernmost sampled populations falling outside Mesoamerica (Pima and Tarahumara) showed a clear differentiation with respect to the other populations, which is in agreement with previous results from mtDNA lineages. However, our results point toward a complex genetic makeup of Native Mexicans whose maternal and paternal lineages reveal different narratives of their population history, with sex-biased continental contributions and different admixture proportions. At a continental scale, we found that Arctic populations and the northernmost groups from North America cluster together, but we did not find a clear differentiation within Mesoamerica and the rest of the continent, which coupled with the fact that the majority of individuals from Central and South American samples are restricted to the Q-M3 branch, supports the notion that most Native Americans from Mesoamerica southwards are descendants from a single wave of migration. This observation is compatible with the idea that present day Mexico might have constituted an area of transition in the diversification of paternal lineages during the colonization of the Americas."
"Now let’s leap to Mars and observe a Martian as described by Major James R. Randolph, engineer, mathematician and physicist, who taught at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, N. Y., and Rhode Island State College and lectures extensively on interplanetary subjects. This is his conception of a Mars inhabitant: He has slender arms and legs, a large chest, wide, flaring nostrils and a broad mouth. His head would be about a quarter the size of his body; his eyes would be dark-adapted, with wide pupils. His size is problematical” Major Randolph’s guess is that he would be about four feet tall but he frankly admits there is no real basis for the assumption."

"The Yale commission’s decision to shut down YIISA is a typical behavior for American academics, promoting anti-Zionism and rather Pro-Islamism, while attacking criticism of antisemitism and Islamism. If we look at public counter-intellectuals like Tony Judt, Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, Judith Butler, Daniel Boyarin, all those Institutes for Middle Eastern Studies, Islamic Studies, Area Studies (or Gender Studies, Philosophy etc. etc.), not to forget Obama’s and Edward Said’s ally Rashid Khalidi: hatred of Israel, anti-Zionism, along with affirmation, trivialization or downplaying of Muslim antisemitism, are conventional wisdom for many elites in the US, especially scholars in the related fields."

"She got some help. I saw a change in her. I hoped that it would continue to get better. In some ways it did and in others it didn't. I retreated to what I knew. I had a hard time sharing (and still do to this day) what was going on inside of me. I learned really early in life that my feelings were not good enough to share with anyone. So I just stuff them deep inside of my heart and don't let anyone in. I have been hurt too many times in the past. I am learning how to open up and allow myself to feel and to allow her to see those feeling as well. I am still scared some days that she will just up and leave me because I don't do or say the right things."

Although mortality and morbidity improved with medical advancements and technological change, individuals that survived childhood diseases prior to the turn of the twentieth century were probably more resilient than our chair bound generation. They also were replete with unfulfilled desires (see any Jane Austin or similar novel) so they probably enjoyed applying their energy to all that bone-grinding hard work."

"A live example I can think of is there was a guy I worked with and I *felt* he was interested but wasn’t really sure. Eventually I thought he was just being a nice guy, but then he dropped the hammer and I was like “HUH where’d that come from!” LOL. IOW’s he was always joking with me and making me laugh but he never really flirted with me in the process. So after a while the original idea I had that he had an interest faded and I suddenly believed he was just a funny guy who loved to joke around and tease. So I thought nothing of it. Well one day he got serious and after a bit of laughing at his jokes and things he just came out and asked me if he could call me. It was just a little awkward and weird b/c it threw me off guard since it was so unexpected and b/c he quickly went from one mood to another. I am not saying it’s a bad thing, but it is awkward when you do too much playful teasing and bantering without mixing in your interest so that when you drop the hammer it’s no surprise to her and she was kinda expecting that all the teasing and flirting was a means to an end."

"Or we could describe the day based on friends. I woke up to a quiet house. My roommate had stayed the night with friends. Ah, the sound of silence. Off to the game. On my way I ran into one of the players, walking her dog to the gym. We talked on our way in. She told me of her latest crush. To the gym where I said hi to another player, chatted with a player’s mom, and sat in the stands to watch warm-ups. During warm-ups I waved to several other players. Another friend came in and we watched the game together. A sad play-off loss, but we still have another chance. Game over, run home to greet friends. My roommate and I had a believing couple and their son over for 5 o’clock tea. Amazing conversation. I am full of thanksgiving for this couple! They leave, and I deliver pastries to the neighbors. These neighbors are my landlord’s sisters and they are a hoot and a half! One is practically blind, the other is basically deaf. Home to fill up a plate with cake, then off to the new neighbors. A new family moved into the building a few weeks ago. As far as I can tell, its two single girls in their 20s/30s and their parents. Their grandparents are staying with them at the moment so their grandma can have tests done at the hospital. The girls recently opened a beauty salon.

They have a friend playing on the other women’s division two basketball team in Ankara. Turkey is indeed a small country."

"For me, the weather-watch begins in earnest a couple days prior to departing. A quick dash over to the National Weather Service site told me that we were in for some unsettled weather in store for our trip – exactly what I wanted to hear as unsettled weather adds drama and excitement to most scenes. There are a plethora of sites offering forecasts, but I go right to the main source and the most experienced meteorologists in the business for my forecast. Partly cloudy skies and a chance of a thunderstorm was in the forecast for the Grand Canyon. Though we did get some nice clouds, I never did hear the crack of thunder. I try not to get overly excited as many forecasts never actually pan out, but I also never venture out without checking. I routinely will change planned location shoots to try and optimize the best light I can find for my participants. In Page, I actually had to eliminate a planned shoot at one location because the forecast called for an 80% chance of thunderstorms. The road was not paved and the area we had planned to photograph was a wash area during flash floods, so I did not feel it met with my safety expectations given the latest weather information. As it turned out, the rain never materialized, at least in Page, but we had no idea what was happening in the surrounding mountains and that is where the flash floods begin. I decided to take the group back to Horseshoe Bend where we had photographed sunset the day before and we were treated to entirely different light from a gorgeous sunrise!"

"VERDICT: There is a good reason why Bobby Flay is a Food Network Iron Chef. He has the gift of adding a variety of ingredients to create a symphony of flavor. My taste buds worked overtime to process the zing of the pomegranate molasses, the sweet of the vanilla bean butter, the crunch of the pecans and the sweet-tart ""pop of the pomegranate arils. I truly loved this dish. Contrary to some reviewers who said this dish was too sweet-- I say that they took shortcuts that cheated them out of what Bobby Flay meant for this dish to be. It's colorful. It's flavorful. It's downright sexy. I will make this for Christmas Eve dinner, for certain. Brussels sprouts, you have arrived in my love life!"

For a powerful analysis of one such period see Three New Deals by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, “Reflections on Roosevelt’s America, Mussolini’s Italy, and Hitler’s Germany, 1933-1939″. In many ways three (4, including Japan) different revolutions, but with profound commonalities."

While those who consider themselves experts on the subject will find interest in the personal perspectives on offer, not to mention the cleverly sought out viewpoint of the hospital itself"

When I began this project, I stuffed my face into books. I saw our history boldly smothered over pages…pages that give some knowledge, but leave out a lot. These missing pieces aren’t easily found once generations pass and homes collapse to the ground. Just as a unique language and dialect is kept inside its people, so is the heart behind traditions, ways of approach and intricacies of lifestyles. Certain patterns cannot be sustained. Other patterns may need to be remembered."

I inked up the Damask texture fade with an Encore Ultimate Metallic Gold pad and ran my black cabinet card panel through it. What a cool texture that created! An opening was cut in the cabinet card panel with the large ticket Mover and Shaper die and the Marche aux Fleurs panel was affixed behind it. Then that entire layer was affixed onto the chipboard cabinet card die cut. All of my butterflies were stamped on white CS, sponged with Broken China and Scattered Straw ink and fussy cut. I just felt that it somehow needed more gold so I added the two bright brass pieces of filigree metals. Oh, and I sprayed the background and the Marche aux Fleurs panel with Biscotti Perfect Pearls before I assembled the entire piece.

"There are also many other peoples in the world who – even as adults – don’t exist in a state of separateness. Most of the world’s indigenous peoples don’t see themselves as separate to their environment. They feel a strong sense of connection to nature, an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation (and one which is no more important than any other). As Tim Ingold writes of the Batek Negritos of Malaysia, for example, ‘They see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants, animals and hala’ [spirits] (including the deities) which inhabit their world.’ Or as the Cherokee Indian scholar Rebecca Adamson points out, for indigenous peoples ‘the environment is perceived as a sensate, conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole.’ The Hopi use the term Novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature, while the Tlingit (also of North America) call it Shogan."

"Don't worry, I'm not about to bad-mouth sippy cups, you'll see the correlation in a paragraph or so. I feel like Satan has been attacking our family since the second we picked up our foster daughter a couple weeks ago. Since her first night here, I have had a child vomiting, sneezing snot everywhere or lethargic with a fever every single day. I came down with strep throat a couple days ago and Seth broke his toe yesterday. Really?! In all honesty, I have been dealing with everything fairly well. We've been living off of frozen meals I'd stashed away and homemade chicken soup. There was one incident when I threw a sippy cup at the wall because I couldn't get the lid off because my joints were aching so badly from my fever. Shortly thereafter I realized that was exactly what Satan wanted and by giving into frustration, I was letting him steal my joy and peace that the Lord has blessed us with."

"*** I guess that, considering how not only the fanzine that I used to crank out but perhaps this very blog is named after an infamous MC5 song which according to Chuck Eddy ""doesn't exist,"" I should respectfully note the recent passing of that group's bass guitarist Michael Davis due to liver failure last week at the not-so-ripe old age of 68. Funny enough, if I had told some old fogy back in the late sixties that a member of a radical longhair rock 'n roll act like the Five would live well into his sixties I'd be more'n positive that this member of the silent majority would scoff at the idea, undoubtedly thinkin' that all of that partaking in drugs 'n an immoral lifestyle would most certainly off the guy before he could hit twenny-five! Funnily enough, many of those old fogies who used to sneer at the hippoids back then are still around and perhaps in some weird way think that Davis got just what was comin' to him even if it was over forty years later!!! Just goes to show you that some things just don't change, and you should be glad about it unless you're a dyed-inna-wood heartbleeder or lack the kinda sense of old-timey values that I most certainly adhere to!"

"I have great beer in the fridge. Tonight felt like a Bob's 47 night, with a crisp bite in the wind outside, me warm inside, watching my Jayhawks dance all over Texas A&M. Boulevard's Bob's 47 is a Munich Style Lager. Very oktoberfest. I poured a bottle of the brew into a glass beer mug, and snapped this picture with my phone. The head pours bubbly, but thin, and quickly dissipates, leaving very light lacing. The color is an orangey-amber, like copper, and very clear, in a filtered sort of way. Sticking my nose into the mug, it smells sweet, a little fruity and slightly spicy. The first sip has a sweet, malty, bready flavor, followed by minor bite, perhaps hops. (The Boulevard site says the beer is brewed with a combination of Pale, Munich, Carapils & Aromatic malts, and Magnum & Hallertau hops.) It is carbonated well to provide some lightness, and the mouthfeel is on the thinner side. This beer presents like it will be too sweet, but the taste left afterwards is a bit dry, only slightly bitter, and drives me to take another sip, and another. Like most of Boulevard's seasonal brews, I wish this one was available for longer periods. Our keg at work is sporting Bob's right now. I have been working overtime lately. :)"

"Industry concentration statistics tell the story here. The conventional measure of concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) ranges from 0 to 10,000; the HHI for the software industry as a whole is less than 244 for software, compared to an average of 334 for U.S. manufacturing industries. What this means is that the top 20 sellers of pre-packaged software generate 61% of total industry revenues. This compares very favorably to other industries, many of which are considered quite competitive: autos, airlines, and personal computers, for example. There is evidence of significant turnover over time as well – a key indicator of a dynamic industry. Of the top ten software companies in 1990, five did not make the list in 2000, either because they went out of business or were acquired. This is remarkable turnover compared to some industries, such as pharmaceuticals, where similar comparisons from 1990 and 2000 show that eight of ten firms made both lists (and the ones that did not were acquired by others that did) Comparative Data on Patents and Innovation - to determine how patents relate to these trends, one area of study looked at comparative data concerning differences between the domestic software industries of various countries. Previous research has shown that as a foreign country moves up the learning curve in the software industry, inventors in the software industry from that country receive more patents. Accordingly, software firms in Israel, Ireland and India were studied to see if the patenting trends hold:"

Same tiles. Same geometric pattern in the tiles. Same shit colored paint on the banisters and handrails. Same mud colored paint on the walls. The same tiny crack vials hiding in the crevices of the stairs leading up to the fifth floor and like all the other buildings in Washington Heights Marley didn’t have to see the roof to know it was carpeted with them."

A picture of him walking or running around...a picture of him throwing his arms around his mama or daddy in a bear hug...a picture of him playing with his brothers and sisters...a picture of him terrorizing his brothers and sisters...a picture of him sitting around the table with his family for dinner...a picture of his adorable first words...a picture is worth a thousand words.

The young guys in the Blue Jackets organization need time to develop properly and adjust to the professional game. Without any top-tier scoring talent outside of Rick Nash (and even he’s not truly elite), nobody else can shoulder the offensive burden and young players are thrust into roles they’re not prepared to take. That only further exposes the shallow and low-end talent in the Blue Jackets prospect pool."

"My favourite story about a philanthropic millionaire concerns Roy Attwater, the pot-noodle tycoon. He hired an Indian gardener to tend to the grounds of his holiday mansion in Florida, and the man kept the lawn and shrubs in prime condition.

Tiring of this annoyance, he set a trap involving raw meat suspended from a string attached to a carton of Madras curry power.

"An odd first choice, I know. While mainly a game focused around combat, this sequel upped the ante on both puzzles and platforming, and the standout sequence where you chased after messenger God Hermes managed to be both exhilarating, challenging, and rewarding without ever overwhelming to the player. How does it manage this? For one thing, unlike the previous games, there are two primary buttons used for platforming. The X button both jumps and glides, and the R1 button cause Kratos to swing and slide down walls. When compared to games that only use one button for platforming, it’s shocking how much more of an impact this has on how the player perceives their actions, as alternating between buttons FEELS significantly more impactful and challenging despite the controls being relatively simple. Apart from controls, the design of this sequence uses two important elements. The first is that you are chasing someone, so already there is a sense of urgency to the platforming that you don’t have in most of the game. Secondly, many sections you are navigating across are dangerous—not only must you chase Hermes, but you must scale a rapidly burning bridge, jump across treacherous falling platforms, and dodge debris collapsing around the area. It’s bombastic enough to be exciting but never overwhelming, challenging without being frustrating. Lastly, it combines all the skills you’ve learned up until this point in the game. They key in that sentence? Skills! It’s next to impossible to design a sequence this memorable when you give the player almost no input on their actions. This section allows a sense of satisfaction that other, less skill-based platformers fail to achieve, while still keeping in line with the rest of the title’s twitch-action gameplay."

"I recently read Search to Belong by Joseph Myers. Myers makes some strong points but ultimately he falls short on the purpose of the church. Myers seems to think that because people have limitation, the church should not encourage deeper relationships. I guess he presumes that most people are already at or near capacity. I don't think that is true. In fact, I think most people are looking for more personal and more intimate relationship, but struggling to find them. That is they struggle to find the godly form of those relationships and thus relationships often are a burden not a joy."

"""Here's to the Hunter"" could easily have been sung by Lee Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra, each taking a sullen chorus in this sullen, sinister story of an encounter between a drifter and a woman living alone. Not that it would've been a hit, but it would've been a respectable album tack, and that would've provided some validation and some royalties."

"A ""mystery boat"" called the Ocean Lady was located and intercepted by Canadian Forces and the RCMP off the northern coast of British Columbia. No visible numbers or flags were seen on the ship so it is likely a smuggling operation. Early news reports state that the ship carried 76 migrants. They are all male with some unconfirmed speculation that children may also be aboard."

"We received a copy of Crypto Mind Benders Famous Quotations published by Critical Thinking Co. to review as members of the TOS Homeschool Crew. Since the book is graded 3grade and up I figured it would be a fun change of pace for Cameron for Math."
"I did some thinking, researching and googling and came up with the conclusion that the red lentils I used and did not soak and rise like I usually do were crossed contaminated with some other gluten-grain. I went back to the bulk package of red lentils that I poured from to make my soup. I usually take the time to soak and rise the lentils, but on this particular day I was in a rush to make dinner and just trough the lentils in the pot and stirred. I regretted that very much when I had a nice pot of soup that had been gluten-fied after it was cooked. I donated the soup to some friends that can eat gluten and rested and waited a few days for the reaction to go away."

"If you’ve visited our Facebook page or signed our petition, or read the previous post on this blog, you’ll have noticed the imagery of David versus Goliath: we are 19 people taking on a multinational company. However, you might not have grasped the full meaning of this analogy. These days, when people think of a David-and-Goliath scenario, it’s in the context of a plucky underdog taking on a more powerful opponent and winning against the odds. But the story of David and Goliath is much more than that."
"EXTRA TIP Did you know that baby carrots we buy in the grocery store aren't 'young' carrots or even 'small' carrots at all? Instead, they are commercial carrots that start with huge carrots that are ground into the bullet-shaped carrots credited with increasing carrot consumption by manyfold in the last decade or so. Like many, I like them for snacking. But when it comes to cooking carrots, choose whole carrots. The trimming and peeling process will take a few minutes but for real carrot flavor, there's no comparison."
"Don't these look fun? The rainbow sprinkles are so cheery. I love them! They're like a celebration all wrapped up into one little bite. They're aptly named Birthday Cake Truffles and can be found at Momofuku's Milk Bar in NYC.

"There are many reasons why Israel exists today, why it should, why it must. Sometimes, you can give a complicated answer, and sometimes, the answer is so simple. Today is a simple one. This morning, a plane flew into Israel from Russia. It was a special flight, sent to there by the State of Israel. On board the plane, as it landed in Israel, was a special medical team, and a young man in critical condition. Aharon Alexander is 25 years old."
"Western resources are not innately centralized, which makes seizing control of them and routing them through a central point more difficult. This has to be done legislatively and has to be justified by a universal benefit or a crisis. One example of this is FDR's Agricultural Adjustment Act which allowed the government to control wheat grown on a farm for private consumption. Another is nationalizing health care by routing the commercial activity of medicine through government organs. Both services and commodities can be controlled in this manner."

"I didn’t know until quite some time after meeting and playing in games with Paul that he had written D&D articles for Dragon. Since Paul only really seemed to like Traveller and other science fiction games at the time, I’m guessing that his heaviest D&D period had been in college. He was writing about stuff he didn’t seem to play anymore (though I think he wrote some Traveller items as well) unless he was doing it away from the shop. The interesting thing was he never talked about those articles. He had zero ego about it. Owner Gary had pointed them out to me. I thought it was pretty cool."

"With that said, I lived in the same house I do now. With my mother, too. It is central to the dream, the house. My mother never appeared, I just know through conversation in the dreamscape that she was there. Meanwhile, there was a roommate who is not real – Judith. She was tall and very thin, dark hair and eyes with an aquiline nose. Jewish, like me. She was beautiful, but absent for the majority of the dream. Maybe she was the personification of my Jewish self, that I never determined."

As a matter of fact, there are some wildlife biologists who are starting to come out, and one in Canada that I know of, John Bindernagel, and he’s a professor of wildlife biology, and he’s basically come out and said, “This is real.” And, you know, jeopardizing his career doing so. There’s a few of them that are starting to come out."

"So my friend Catherine has great style. I always find myself copying her without meaning too, but hopefully she finds it flattering...after all imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, right? Well, first she got me obsessed with scarves. My wardrobe is somewhat basic, without a lot of patterns. I never understood how much pizazz a scarf can give a plain outfit! But now she has me addicted to nail polish. I have always had a love of makeup, but in the past I have never really made time for my nails. I think that is going to change! I just feel like anything you can do to make yourself feel pretty and boost your self-esteem is a good thing. I'm not saying that someone needs makeup and a manicure to be beautiful. However, taking care of yourself (including your outer appearance) is very healthy in my opinion."

"By the time the prequels came out, we were still lining up at the local multiplexes and swapping theories in line and trying to remember where we put our vintage lightsabers and Darth Vader helmets. A new generation born when Star Wars first debuted were now standing in line with us. Star Wars was no longer just a blockbuster series of films (oh remember the scorn of the learned film snobs as teenagers flooded back in the movie houses) but now was totally immersed into our cultural and even political folklore. And standing again in line on this date for the next three more films, we too echoed the same greeting as we held our tickets and waited to get into the Uptown on Connecticut Avenue in DC, indeed, ""May the 4th be with you."""

"For some strange reason, the first time I saw the teaser for Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl (LVRB), I caught the last frame where Ranveer stares at the viewer with the words “you’re next” leading me to think this was a film about a serial killer – however, thanks to the de rigeur incessant promotion of films in general these days, that notion was quickly put to rest. But there was no avoiding the red and white nightingale voiced elephant in the room that is Band Baaja Baaraat – after all, this is the first film reuniting Maneesh, Anushka and Ranveer since BBB (which took us all by surprise and made itself comfortable in our hearts and minds) and expectations were high. And try as we might, the comparison with BBB would remain, despite the best of intentions."

"There is also my Family History Project. Before my grandmother died, and my father's brothers and cousin, I interviewed them after I had attended an Oral History course with the Alexander Turnbull Library. I got a lot of invaluable material about where I came from, and discovered how interesting some of my family members were. Also, I have a collection of family photos, going back to my great grandparents' wedding in the 19th century, and a few strange things such as a book which belonged to my paternal grandfather, a pair of his braces, and a beautiful china teapot that my maternal grandparents brought with them from England. This needs to be tidily stored but not somewhere susceptible to damp. Actually I rarely need to access it as extended family never comes over (on account of them living in the North Island) and my daughter and I are not that interested any more. If it is all arranged neatly though, perhaps the responsibility for storing it can be offered to another family member."

"Probably the best pub we found was Horse Brass a traditional english pub a short cab ride out of downtown. In addition to a great selection of local brews, this quaint timber-laden bar had a good selection of internationally acclaimed brews such as Weihenstephaner and Affligem. The passionate and knowledgable staff didnt make it hard to pursuade the uninitiated to jump from local to global. We even shouted some locals a bottle of Duchesse de Bourgogne. I am ashamed to say, the West Coast IPA had worn a little thin by now."

I'm sure I even got a pint of Fyne Ales' Jarl for £1.60 in Hengler's this year."
"I will say that taking the three private lessons made a HUGE difference. You CANNOT CANNOT get the proper Pilates stuff from a DVD without first knowing what you are going for. It's been challenging for me because I'm great at powering through stuff but not so great at using only one specific muscle. Doing a sit up has a whole new meaning now for me. Because I have to isolate my transverse abs and pull up from only that muscle, sit ups take a long time. To someone watching, it must look like I'm just laying on the floor making weird faces and occasionally lifting my head. But I'm working HARD. And seeing results, even if they are small. Three weeks ago, I couldn't lift my head off the floor without torquing my entire body. Now I can use just my transverse abs and my head can float off the floor. Amazing."
"You certainly live and learn."
"Decrease the oven temperature to 200°F. Place the baking sheets in the oven; bake until the meringues are crisp on the outside but have a marshmallow consistency inside, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

Remove from the oven and let cool completely on a wire rack."

I will do my best to see if I can get some more for you during the week, but I’m not rushing this. These are simple games and I should just get them right. I’m hoping eventually I will have a momentum built that will allow me to produce quickly, but I want to ensure every game I release is complete. Too many developers will make a great game with stick figures (intentionally or not) or an animator will learn just enough code to make that awesome artwork game do practically nothing (1 button rpgs can be this way).

"Then, instead of entering the clergy, as any grateful scholarship boy with an MA should, Marlowe became a ‘a filthy Play-maker’ and gained a reputation as an atheist. Shortly after his death, pamphlets circulated, telling how he’d been killed in a tavern brawl, and calling him ‘a Poet of scurrilite’, and ‘a barking dogge.’ They said he ‘cursed and blasphemed to his last gaspe’, that he was killed ‘in a Baudy-house,’ and that, ‘Thus did God, the true executioner of divine justice, worke the ende of impious Atheists.’"
"For some weird reason, my mind went straight to unmarried middle aged women who have decided to have children after years of waiting for the right man. Sometimes, I wonder how I would feel if I was in my late thirties, successful in every area of my life, and single. I wonder if I would really crave having a man to look after and who would look after me. I wonder if I would be worried about my biological clocking ticking away every month. I wonder if I would do what most women in that situation do – ditch the man and get the kid."

"This Mother's Day will be special. Mrs. Tildon got up early and fried up a deliciously plump chicken she'd purchased at the Piggly Wiggly the night before. The grandchildren love her fried chicken and on occasion, when the mood strikes, she succomes to their pleadings. It has been said by those in Cloverdale with the most discriminating palettes, that the chicken fried in the Tildon kitchen far exceeds anything from the Kentucky Fried Chicken on Main and Elm Streets in taste and quality. Such talk appears to embarrass Mrs. Tildon, but in reality, it is most welcome but never sought after."

All his origin stories focus on him running around a farm, lifting tractors and such, but they overlook what happens when he discovered his powers and his wiener at the same time. Sure, he’d probably stop a 3-story tall rampaging robot, but he’d also be masturbating constantly (he’d never get chafed, he’s freaking invulnerable). No one would look at him like a hero if they knew what he got up to when he was exploring his super-sexuality. “Sure, he saved that bus full of kids, but did you see that video of him supersonically masturbating on the moon? That dude’s messed up.”"

"Young children are eager to learn and as parents and educators we should jump on this eagerness with glee and use the tools at our disposal to ensure they can develop important creative skills such as imagination and curiosity. Illustrated picture books are the first step in learning to read and opening up a whole new world of understanding and the endless scope of imagination. As the phrase goes, ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" and it’s worth many billions more when you consider the value illustrations can have in a child’s education, development and creativity. An active imagination is a fantastic faculty to possess and the power of art and illustration is key to building it in our children."

He could be arrested and charged with a thought crime for this speech, and no mistake. That is Britain today: softened up for 60 years by the Left, which now works hand in hand with radical Muslims, each imagining the other a tool to be discarded later."

"After having my first bite, I knew instantly that I love the sweetness of the pumpkin. and the aromatic sage which was use as a veg. Since then, I just had to recreate this dish for myself. To begin, I don't have a recipe nor did I look it up. I just wanted a challenge to myself; and relied a lot on my own taste bud."

"I’ve known about Nanogen since 2008 when, at my first ever paid acting job (a guest episode of Eastenders), the make-up lady got this little blue pot out of her bag of tricks and started shaking it vigorously over my head. At the time it changed my life. I had never heard of such a product and the difference was remarkable to say the least. I have since bought several pots and use it when acting/for special occasions/ on bad hair days. It is a very good, temporary solution to a glaringly obvious scalp."
"So, I’m already plotting our next trip back and came across this cool tip from the Met’s website. It’s rooted in one of my all-time fav books as a kid: ”Read From the Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, by E.L. Konigsburg, before your visit and ask the kids where they would hide if they wanted to stay in the museum overnight. Then, take advantage of the proximity of Central Park to take a little time out from art with some playtime in the Ancient Playground next door.” I’m determined to get back to continue our journey. I’ll keep you posted on the next adventure."

Mom is running door to door recruiting an army of frantic neighbors desperately searching for the boy. Mom sees us and runs over sobbing uncontrollably. We do our best to get the boy's description, clothing, and possible destinations. She tells us Dad is driving around the area and several neighbors can be heard yelling his name and checking bushes, garages, and cars."

He's not awful, but nor is he memorable (ballads will do that). He's patently unoffensive, but nor does he make people want to pick up the phone or send a gazillion texts for him.

"Pepy's records of his food and drink are useful to the social historian, but in content they are rather scant and frequently only list those foods and dishes which he found notable. His accounts of his stone feasts are among his most detailed entries. His day to day comments on his diet tell us a lot about his food preferences. Since he mentions it nearly fifty times, one of his favourite dishes seems to have been the luxury meat venison, which he usually encountered in the form of venison pasty. Sam usually enjoyed this high status dish, but he also had some bad experiences, such as at a dinner on 1st August 1667 at the house of his next door neighbour, the parliamentarian and admiral Sir William Penn, 'Up, and all the morning at the office. At noon my wife and I dined at Sir W. Pen’s, only with Mrs. Turner and her husband, on a damned venison pasty, that stunk like a devil. However, I did not know it till dinner was done. We had nothing but only this, and a leg of mutton, and a pullet or two.'"

She does this role seemingly so well, and so easily, that you’re brimming with hate, you can’t wait for Andy to quit.

"Her rump is really sloping… which to me is less than ideal, but she has good legs and the rest of her frame is nice so I am hoping she will end up throwing some good looking kids.

"Many years ago I put forward this theory to a bunch of friends in the pub whilst out with Geri (my Number 6). At the end of the night we went home and fucked (I can’t say that for certain, but we fucked a lot, so it’s a pretty safe assumption) and nothing more was said on the subject. Until a few days later, when Geri presented me with an elephant posing pouch and a pink men’s G-string."

She's sole trustee of the Alaska Fund Trust, the personal slush fund for the Palin family, which was found by the investigator hired by the personnel board to be unethical and/or illegal, yet still continues to solicit donations. Appointed to head the Board of Agriculture and Conservation by Palin, a farm regulatory position that by state law must go to someone with strong agricultural and business experience. She continues to run this position with an iron fist, removing anyone who would question her authority, even though her appointment expired in '09. Appointed herself Chair of the Matanuska Creamery, a private dairy that sprung up after the hostile takeover of Mat Maid by the Corrupt Bitches Club, that continues to drain state and federal money at an alarming rate. I guess as a real estate agent, perhaps she sold a farm sometime giving her the qualifications for these positions and it shows."

"This 1935 photomontage by John Heartfield has been coming to mind a lot. Obviously during the Bush Administration with the cutting of nearly all funding in favor of the war and its no-bid contracts. But now, just the sentiment of its main phrase. It fits the ironic joys of our time. If you can't find anything to be joyful about, find joy ironically in what is most obviously wrong. So as I look at the country, and the Republicans' concerted effort to not only maintain the idiocy of the past years, but make sure any new policies are strangled at birth if not stillborn, I look to the future and say: ""Hurray! The butter is all gone!"" Ah, but we still have our tax cuts, our over $250K/year tax cuts."

When I shut it off and remove the key, the seat automatically slides all the way back so you can easily get out, which is fine. However, then when you come back and unlock the doors the seat automatically slides way up forward. So far forward, that I can’t even get in. Then I have to push a button on the dash and to move it back into my previously memorized position. I told Bill I wanted it just to stay all the way back until I get in, then I can push the button and have it slide into my memorized ""personal"" position. Bill says, “OK, we can do that”. He pushed a few buttons, turned the key switch off and on a couple times and said “There, try that”. Awwww....perfect, that’s the way I want it. Whew, glad to get that done. I must have tried to do that 50 times and couldn’t get it right. I knew Bill could do it. So we were off to see Prescott....you know the usual places, Costco, Sam’s and Wal-Mart. Then, of course, the Gun Shop!!"

She kind of gagged and I told Lynn to get a bag from my purse but we missed most of it. Poor thing. Did this mom know she gets car sick? Yes, I did but she had been doing so well that I thought they might have been mistaken. I felt so bad for the driver, he has a mess in the back of his very nice van.

But after indeterminate misadventures during the revolution and civil war, Mitya lost that position. His return now is both unexpected and mildly threatening; his strained smiles hide an eerie malice and a deep self-loathing. Things take a turn for the worse when we learn that Mitya's arrival is not merely a personal visit."

It took me fourteen months to write this current draft, which currently runs about 126,000 words or about 400 pages. I think it'll take another year to revise it sufficiently so I can show it to people in the publishing industry. This draft took a while to write, because I was doing research every step of the way, even though I'd done a lot of my initial reading back in 2003, and had been able to lay out a pretty decent outline for the story at that time. (I was able to use quite a bit of my old outline, thought it shifted a lot.)"

And I did. I took a few that summer as I trained to run 26.2 miles. After my one and only marathon I decided I liked running 13 miles much better than 26, quickly taking my insanity level down a notch. Training for a half marathon meant half as much time training, half as many aches and pains and made ice baths a distant memory. In fact the last time someone mentioned an ice bath I declared I would only take an ice bath after running 18 miles or more, which I have no plans to do as of right now."

"Given the lack of apparent grand, alternative narratives to neoliberalism, we are forced to look for the budding, small scale alternatives that are growing around us. Bolivia, where resistance to the social suffering caused by the neoliberal revolution began in the 1990s, can provide a few useful lessons and visions of what the future might hold for us. For, in the process of implementing popular responses to neoliberalism’s worst excesses, Bolivia and other Latin American countries have had a head start that is decades long."

"The police do nothing except hide the truth for fear of breaching the dictates of political correctness, and the case of Charlene was handled so incompetently by the police and the CPS that the scum who murdered her were acquited AND THEN GIVEN £250,000 BY THE COURTS AS COMPENSATION FOR BEING KEPT ON REMAND."

"It was timely that Troy and Carreen were here during the holidays because Miguel and I went up to our fourth level roof to watch the fireworks. The only access to the roof is via a long ladder propped against the edge of the wall. Up on that terrace are our water tanks. And nothing else. So when the ladder fell when we tried to come down after the fireworks, we were rather stranded. Nobody available to come and help us at 12:15 on New Year's Eve, no hidden key in case a neighbor could be roused, and no piece of rope. Nothing."

"The lovely thing is, lack of setting is an easy boo-boo to fix. And when you bang that nail into place, the overall effect on the manuscript is substantial. If you write teen/tween novels, take a look at your current work-in-progress. Is it all action and dialogue? Or have you given us enough sensory detail to fill out the space around the characters?"
"The latest release from the Southern California sextet marks a return to their ska-punk roots, evoking memories of 2003’s Rump Shaker. Day Job is missing some of the disco flair and poppy flourishes that characterized some of the band’s more recent releases, but it retains all of the infectious energy, hilarious lyrics, horn-driven melodies, and all-around fun that Suburban Legends are known for. It’s an excellent ska album and an all-around good time."

"But it does show how silly this is all getting, with Bob grasping at anything no matter how flimsy to try to ”win”. The whole point that I am making, and which Bob seems not to grasp, is that none of this is magisterial. The opinion of these editors is not magisterial. Period. They have no office in the Church, no commission from the Church, no sanction from the Church, no explicit endorsement from the Church. Their contention that the seventeenth century documents concerning Copernicanism proceeded from the “Roman Pontiffs” is just their opinion and has no authority. There were plenty of other Catholics during that same period pointing out what I and others have pointed out more recently, namely, that the position against Copernicanism “(a) was promulgated only in disciplinary documents, not in formally doctrinal ones; (b) was never promulgated directly and personally by any Pope, only indirectly, through the instrumentality of the Vatican Congregations of the Index and the Holy Office” (Fr. Brian Harrison, Roma Locuta Est - Causa Finita Est)."

"I have become a fan of Patrick Blanc since seeing his 260sq m creation on the outside of London's Athenaeum Hotel. In the heart of Mayfair and across the road from Green Park, Blanc installed ten thousand green plants of more than two hundred varieties to cascade down ten floors. In Paris one of his most outstanding vertical gardens can be seen at Quai Branley, the museum for indigenous art designed by Jean Nouvel. According to Blanc, vertical gardens can be hung in the tightest of spaces to provide an escape and a way to experience nature for those of us locked into urban living."

"Florence was strip searched after his arrest on a warrant for an unpaid fine, even though the fine had been paid. The court majority rejected Florence’s suggestion that new detainees who are not arrested for serious crimes be exempt from strip searches as “unworkable,” noting that the seriousness of an offense is a poor predictor of who has contraband. In a dissent for the court’s more-liberal members, Justice Stephen Breyer said, “I cannot find justification for the strip search policy at issue here-a policy that would subject those arrested for minor offenses to serious invasions of their personal privacy.”"
"Children are selfish, but become civilized as they grow older and take responsibility for the world around them. This is becoming adult. But the new culture prevents them from growing up and keeps them immature which is causing so much uncivilised behaviour. Bar owners and the drinks companies play on the weaker part of people’s nature rather like a sales scam would play on, say, someone’s greed. It is preying on the young’s need for fun and adventure with unhealthy adventures."

I also wrote out a complete outline for A Hollywood Miracle, which I didn't really intend to do when I sat at the computer, but now that I have it, I'm going to use it. I bought some colored post-its so I can use different colors for each storyline. That way I can merge all the storylines on some sort of board, and easily be able to pick out each storyline."

"Three to Get Deadly was an easy read. It didn't require a lot of my time, attention, or brain power (which is a good thing, because I seem to be running low on all three). I enjoyed the story, but more because it was easy-on-the-brain than because it was any good. Chances are, if you've made it this far in the series, you aren't a particularly sensitive reader. This novel has just as much profanity and sexually suggestive (or blatant) dialogue as its predecessors. Once again, Stephanie ends up in hot, steamy water with Morelli and while I am rooting for them, as a couple, I don't necessarily feel like I need to read everything about it. Maybe just a little. Like some really nice kissing."
"So I hung out there for a while. Eventually he took me home. I toileted Dug (who was NOT happy with me for pulling him out of his comfy bed… but since he’s small enough I can pick him up he didn’t really get a vote) and then got in bed and vegged till I fell asleep."

"3) Resolutions give wings to discipline – Paul told Timothy, “discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness” (1 Timothy 4:7), but Paul was not saying this as some mountaintop guru who intended Timothy to figure out what that meant on his own. No, instead, Paul gave Timothy specific goals to meet with the discipline he commanded – “set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity” (4:12); “Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching” (4:16). Without goals discipline will fizzle in time because, like a runner without a finish line, discipline without aim is just exertion."

"As my Starbucks habit continued to grow more and more disturbing, my drinks get more and more complicated. At first, it was just an Americano—probably the healthiest thing on the list at 10 wholesome coffee calories. Then, it was a sugar-free-vanilla-Americano. Then, I discovered soy lattes. I can’t really drink milk, it kills me, which means I can’t ever get their trendy “skinny latte” and prance around in big sunglasses pretending I’m not drinking a worthless 200 calories because it says “skinny” in the name."

So this incredible girl set out to organize a massive collection in her community and has now donated over 75,000 books through her Just 1 Book program. Now Sarah’s hitting the road in a book mobile. Watch the video on her website and just try not to feel inspired."

"When Dad moved to Texas and my mom, sister and eventually my brother once he was born, moved in with my mom's folks, I stayed with Grandma and Grandpa from January through June of my 8th grade year so I could finish the school year. It was the 2nd happiest time of my childhood. I had so much fun with my friends but the true reason for my happiness was that I was surrounded and immersed in unconditional love every day, all day long. That was the real gift of my grandparents. They gave me unending, unconditional love without reservations. No matter how much of a smartmouth I was, no matter how much of a brat, no matter how much I failed to appreciate them properly, they never once stopped loving me or being proud of me. Hell, my grandfather never so much as raised his voice to me in my life and even when I was a teenager, 6ft tall and towering over my grandmother, she always had a lap for me to lay my head in and cry if I needed it. They never once gave up on me. Not once."

"Until today when the Chinook winds blew in the warmth and sun. I have cabin fever something awful and yearn to get out and explore like we did before the baby was born. The baby isn't actually keeping me from exploring, it's my own perception that ""it's hard to get out with a baby."" Which it's not, really. She's a mellow little trooper. So we headed down to Pueblo Reservoir, as we were curious as to what it's like."

Then we're ushered into the dinning room where there are six seats at the dinning room table and four at the bar (for those who would like to watch the chef work his magic in the open kitchen). Jen is the ultimate hostess and server, as she always served the women first. And Ryan is the passionate chef who described each course with the most descriptive and appetizing words before we literally started to dig in with our ""ooohhhhss"" and ""aaahhhhss"", giving repetative compliments to the chef."

I made these on a Friday evening so that breakfast would be all ready to go on Saturday morning.

"With St. Louis, the history is longer. My dad has always rooted for St. Louis. Maybe he inherited it from his dad, for he often told us kids how much our grandfather loved baseball (I'm pretty sure that's why my brother signed up for little league all those years). I also know that my grandfather's dad moved from Missouri to Idaho as a young man."

"Everyone can pshaw me. I have a complex about being treated as younger than I am. I will say, I know I look younger, which is fine in social situations and not an issue for me. Usually this bugs me most in a work situation. It is getting more fun to say I'm in my late thirties, but still, I get the ""you're still young"" statement at work more times than I can count. In my twenties, I thought, fair enough, but I do have ideas I would like to try. In my early thirties, sure, I've only been out of grad school for 5-10 years, I need to get some time under my belt. But now I'm starting to get a bit peeved. How many years should one expect to be in the work force to get respect for experience? So I keep thinking that maybe 40 is the magical number. That this is the time that people will say, ""Ok, yeah, she's been around the block a few times."" On the other hand, I have always worked with people older than me, so I guess they deserve to lord their years of experience over me. But I would like them to acknowledge that I have spent enough time in my business to warrant a nod of recognition that I do know what I am doing, on occasion."

"He offers to help, like thread stuff on to skewers and stuff, but god it takes an awful lot of time, Ro being the perfectionist he is, and asks at least 10 different questions on how to do it. Did I tell you I have no patience to answer to people when I'm in the midst of something? Well, my husband of 6 yrs doesn't get it and keeps asking me 'does the tomato have to always go in first? Why are we threading it, cant we just pile it all in a bowl and serve, its going into peoples mouths, no one cares. To avoid all this nonsense, I don't ask him to help with preps. Trust me, its a smart move, because over involved husbands are a pain to deal with, I've seen some and I don't want to encourage it. So the rule in our household is..if you need help, ask for it."
"I took the day off from work and was going to take the day off from blogging (especially since no nerdy movies came out this past weekend) but after catching up on Falling Skies and being asked my thoughts about it…well…it seems I just can’t quit you. Not even for a day."

"The leaves have started to fall on the deck; I was hoping I would have rented out this place before that happened. What a Karen Carpenter moment, the drama, the symbolism. I wanted a neat ending with my lovely Victorian dream. I wanted to leave it in the summer, to leave while the flowers still breezed, swayed and shone crimson through orange to agapanthus blue, with hints of lavender lingering. But no for almost twenty four hours torrid rain fell and cold winds blew and the leaves began to fall. I pictured I would hand over my flat to the prospective tenants, professionals, wrapped in a Cath Kidson type glove, they would imagine I was going off on some mid life adventure, teaching in Mumbai or Kenya. Climbing in the Andes, rafting in the American west and somehow the Cath Kidson glove would allow me to walk away from this dream into another under a veil of romance. The truth, which hurts, is far bleaker. I need to let my flat to save some money for gender reassignment surgery. I am not sure if even doing this will amount to enough. I may have to do one nipple at a time, an inch of electrolysis, a simple line drawing of a vagina. A quick calculation reveals that to have my whole face cleared of hair will cost me a couple of thousand and I am not that hairy, seriously I am not. There is a connection between my leaves and the stubble on my face, I’m sure. Or maybe that’s too neat. I have a lot of work to do how ever you dress it up and autumn is the time when the work starts, in the garden, around the house, paintwork, stubble, saving. I cannot say I have ever liked or enjoyed the autumn months and apart from Christmas day I can do without winter. Cold slushy dim days and long dark inky nights only make me desperate for the suns warmth and flowers. Tulips aside when May arrives I smile again and like a lizard defrost on a warm rock. Then plant seeds and small plants, dahlias, grasses, things that whistle in the breeze, flowers that smell of far off places and sweet perfumes I have yet to find. If the summer is all about longings is the cold dark autumn and winter about acceptance. Should I embrace the falling leaves, sweep and collect them with joy, love and contentment? I have to accept messy, unclear transitions; the space between autumn and summer; winter and spring."

It was trail magic when our paths crossed and we began collaborating on a 'Puppy up!' song to share the inspiration from our travels. Dr. Joshua, as he's known, is a gifted pianist, soulful singer, and helped capture the spirit of our mission. He wasn't able to walk the final mile in Boston so I took his place on the stage and gave er all I got."

"Then there are also classic essay sort of bloggers - say, me? - who, while we write about our lives as parents, are happy to accept certain opportunities like phone calls with Gloria Steinem and sitcom set visits because they are experiential. They fit into our lives, they provide content for our blogs, and they give us the ability to make jokes about celebrity urine that then the Wall Street Journal can go and attribute to someone else."
"We have a stellar group of Graduate Assistants coming back to help us with all the details of planning, presenting, workshopping, trouble-shooting, helping new students get adjusted, etc. I don't know how we would do it without them, and I love hearing them read from their works-in-progress. Every summer our residency also coincides for the first weekend with the Alumni Mini-Residency, so I get to see former students and get an update from them about how their writing (and their families, jobs, etc.) are going."

"We purchased this cradle from someone I work with. We thought we'd put some of the things we'd purchased already for the baby in the cradle. We bought the pink snowsuit days after finding out we were pregnant. I saw it at Macy's and wanted it. I figured if we had a boy, I'd just return it later. There are two shirts that say My Aunt is the Best and I Love My Aunt that my sister, Julie, brought to the party. The blue suit with the elephants my husband purchased because I loved it."

"There you have it. Buying too much whisky, spending too much on advertising and making too many dodgy loans were the causes of the crisis at Pattison's. You can add to that lavish spending on buildings. The offices on Constitution Street couldn't have been cheap. Add to that several enormous warehouses and it's easy to see how a lot of capital could have been eaten up. But it's the whisky stocks that were key. And the valuation put on them. We'll learn more about that when the Pattison brothers are in the dock."

"Here's an emergent reader that I made too;) First, we look for the sight words on each page and highlight them. Then, we read the sentence and the kiddos have to sound the word out and write it on the line. Since they are so involved in writing and finding the words, they get SOOOOO excited about reading it:)! We first did a book like this from Deanna Jump's Scarecrow unit! My kiddos LOVED it soooo much, that I decided to make more of them. Hope your kiddos have fun with it too:) Click on the image below to get a copy of this book!"

"The town pub was the Bedford, in Tunbridge Wells, literally a stone's throw from the town's main railway station. The pub formed a welcome refuge from the wet and wind-swept streets on an unseasonably cold Saturday lunchtime; my visit being as a member of our local CAMRA branch who had gathered there to present licensee Simon Lewis with a well deserved certificate as joint runner-up in our annual Pub of the Year competition. It was my first visit to the Bedford since Simon took over the running of the pub in July of last year, and I have to say I was well impressed."
"Will he come after her? Will he drag her back to London, quelling her mission to rescue her treasure-seeking parents, or might he decide to throw caution to the wind and choose Foy Pour Devoir: “Faith for Duty,” the St. Easton motto.

"It seems the dance is reinstated. For those who give their whole life to immerse themselves in the ocean of His words, they live in another world and are creating a new attractor for the dance, a new way of being. For those who are fishing from that ocean, not convinced that they can live within, new products and forms are brought forth. Those who wander on the beach head notice the remnants of recent generations of effort, wasted in the sand, and are inspired. And those who spend their days eking an existence from a briny wastewater, hear only rumours of a seemingly mythological paradise, and ignore them."

"The whole damn world. I think that when people are first learning about unschooling, it can be helpful to point out specific ways to find knowledge and gain skills, but when it really comes down to it, learning is everywhere. Whether walking in the woods, reading a book on architecture, going to Spanish class, talking to a friend, or contemplating clouds, learning is happening. And I think that's one of the biggest paradigm shifts people make as they move towards unschooling: seeing that learning happens everywhere, all the time, not just between certain times in the day, or when engaging in certain activities."
"My husband and I recently decided to give composting a try. We have lots of grass clippings, leaves, and such around the house PLUS lots of garbage that a family of five creates. We like to garden and would like to do more of it and have healthier plants and flowers. Sounds pretty win-win to me!"
"Megatron has been released differently in the US and Japan. He was not released in the First Edition line in the US, but was released as a First Edition Deluxe by Takara. He was supposed to released in a Hasbro Entertainment Pack as a deluxe figure with Optimus Prime and the kids from the Cartoon. So far that has not happened. Next he came out as a RID voyager figure in the US, then an Arms Micron deluxe figure in Japan."

"This isn’t any kind of a loophole around the laws of thermodynamics, but maybe you don’t need to circumvent them, if energy can be grabbed from plausible sources, in such quantities that it might seem effectively free to us. I can’t rule that out, but the problem then comes back to the perennial sticking point: if you want to be taken seriously, publish some damn science. If you actually do an experiment, and find something to support your claims, and then tell other people what you did so that they can try it too and see if you’re still right, then vindication surely awaits. But what you’re saying sounds unlikely, and it sounds very similar to some other unlikely-sounding things, which are demonstrable nonsense and which break many well established laws of science. You’re going to have to actually show us something impressive."
"I mount this moment for that noisy, dirty Town of Boston, where Parade, Pomp, Nonsense, Frippery, Folly, Foppery, Luxury, Polliticks, and the soul — Confounding Wrangles of the Law will give me the Higher Relish for Spirit, Taste and Sense, at Weymouth, next Sunday."

"Today there is a shrine to Lydia and a small chapel beautifully constructed and adorned with icons where Lydia came to faith. These were beautiful to be sure. But the really moving moment came when I walked to the shoreline of this fast-moving stream. Some of the building stones from the old Apian Way are still there. In a bend in the river, we could imagine Paul and Lydia entering the stream where her faith was confirmed in baptism. With her were members of her household, Luke tells us. Whether they were only adults or included children is unknown. What we do know is that Lydia’s informed faith (she believed in the God of the Jews) was claimed by the Risen Messiah, Jesus."

"Mr. Feinberg cut his policy teeth at The Heritage Foundation. He later served as an aide to U.S. Sens. Tom Coburn and Rand Paul, two fellas who know a thing or two about sound economics."
"I had a massage when I was pregnant with Forest and worried about how to mother this passel of kids I seem to have acquired. The massage therapist told me, ""Remember that you are magical... that's what they need from you."" I spent some time wrestling with that in my head--the practical mid-westerner in me (oh yeah, it's still in there somewhere) said, ""Ha! Magical! Ha!"" and then the free-spirited forest dweller said, ""She's so right"" Guess who won? Both. Neither. It's still a wrestling match. Some days I feel too wiped by the aforementioned mundane details to be very magical. The laundry piles up, no one likes what's for dinner, the baby pinches and bites and hits me, homeschooling is a fight and no one played their instruments. And then I remember that I am magical and powerful beyond my wildest dreams in their lives, simply because I am their mother. And, I can use my magic to sprinkle just a little more fairy dust into their lives before they slip out of Neverland forever (the baby teeth are nearly gone, and each one lost is rejoiced over!) Or, I can be the wicked queen who pushes my agenda on those in my realm. Gee--it's a tough choice. Actually, it is not always easy to choose to allow them to follow their dreams and feel their feelings fully---it makes for a lot of noise and mess, and sometimes I just want my fairy godmother to come in and offer me a spa trip and a massage--I'll be back by midnight, really, I will."

"You see, in the hinterlands of our nation - that is, the part that is NOT Texas - people do not necessarily view this state as a desirable place to live. When I told people that I was considering moving to Austin, many said, ""Wow, Austin is supposed to be great...but, it's in TEXAS. They're CRAZY down there."" I did wonder about the wisdom of deep, deep blue me, moving to the reddest of the red lands (albeit to the little blue heart right smack in the center of the state)."

"What would happen if, like Jesus and A2, we put the hard demands of the gospel front and center? If we dispensed with slick campaigns and puffed up promises and gave people the unvarnished truth of what it means to follow Jesus? If we told them that sometimes following the Carpenter from Nazareth means donning your own crown of thorns? I’m sure it would cost us numbers up front, but would it be worth it in the end? I think it would be. How about you?"
"1-Juicing can be done many ways with all different types of produce. My current favorite combo is what I use two to three times per week for this season including things I find at the farmers market. It’s important to understand that using foods out of season will effect your immune system, the ability to acclimate to the seasonal temperatures/climates and overall well being. Shopping at your local farmers markets will assure you have the best quality produce for your body during the current season. My choice for equipment is the Jack LaLanne Juicer…had mine for over 10 years now and it’s still a champ!!!"

"My goal was to explore the multiple meanings of this place, and how people created a sense of community through local institutions like the church, the schools, the workplace.

"Yesterday while chatting with my lovely doctor, she of the Australian accent who is Greek in culture and heritage, she asked me if I got dressed every day. I looked at her with a question on my face and she explained further...do I put on real clothing (note the term real clothing) or do I stay in my pjs all day or just throw on sweat pants. I realized what she was getting at -- is my mood such that I can barely force myself to leave the house...and I can happily report that I do get dressed every day. And never go out in public in sweat pants. To each her/his own. But I feel it's like saying ""I give up"" or ""I don't care"" if I don't at least put on an ""outfit"" that consists of jeans or dress pants. I have been known to run errands on the weekend in a track suit but I never feel like I'm really ""dressed"". But that's me. I never went to one of my sons' hockey, soccer or baseball games in anything but a pulled together outfit and make up."
"A little after nine, I got up, ate some bread, and then made my way to the market to admire my handiwork. As I approached, a tall nord named Brynjolf began speaking to me. He told me he could tell my pockets were a little light. I got pissed at the scum, but I spoke a little too quickly. He offered to do a con with me, and after hearing the details, I gladly accepted. All I had to do was lift a silver ring from another Madesi’s stall, which I had already broken into, and then plant it no the dark elf Brand-shei. Easy as a sweet roll. For his part of the deal, Brynjolf distracted everyone in the square with promises of some revolutionary new product he was selling. The suckers went for it without hesitation. Taking advantage of their ignorance, I crept up through some crates behind Brand-shei and dropped the ring right into his pocket. Job well done. The poor bastard was about to have a rude surprise.”"

"I know the issue of violence by mental health patients is extremely difficult and powerfully emotive – it has been suggested that stories like this reinforce stigma and unrealistic stereotypes because they significantly over-emphasize the potential to be the victim of such an attack. I get that completely. I can only repeat the point that this blog is about policing and the role it plays in supporting mental health processes as well as the role it plays in protecting society from harm as we do with all manner of violent crime. Incidents such as this are an infrequent but recurring part of policing. Most are far less serious incidents and get referred to the police as a part of the wider, more extended mental health system. This is where my ‘venn diagram’ of policing, mental health and criminal justice is relevant."

"As an adult, my husband often enjoys participating in story time. He’s an excellent reader with good inflection and fluid articulation and the kids don’t mind giving me a break every once in a while to let Dad read. Well, one of the series that really drew him in was the Laura series. Kevin fell in love with the Ingalls and Wilder families, but he’s partial to Almanzo, the man Laura ended up marrying. Almanzo, like Kevin, loved big breakfasts. Doughnuts, apple pie, eggs and sausage or bacon, cheese, and, of course, Johnnycakes."

"The latter shows the complete upsetting of someone’s apparently secure equilibrium – it’s a snapshot of that moment, just after you’ve fallen over (come on, we’ve all done it at some time or other), when you attempt to make out as though nothing at all has happened, when your face does that funny, contorted smile thing as you try to express absolute nonchalance: ‘What? Oh, that?… I meant to do that’. Your eyes betray you; your eyes say, ‘WTF just happened?!’"

"When I learned that there was some ghost writer creating the books from the TV show & writing as Richard Castle, that the actor went to book signings & no one knew who was actually putting pen to paper, I was fascinated. When I picked it up & realized that it read just like the show watches, I was very pleased – and when I realized that unlike TV, Heat & Rook (Rook – Castle – get it?) actually get together, I was very very happy. If you like the TV show, the books are a must IMO."
"Which support for government at an all - time low Athens is using the police force more and more to deal with the fallout from its reforms, a policy that is fraught with risk and the potential for re-igniting the large scale violence that Greece witnessed in December 2008 when a 15 year old was shot by a police officer. Already the Keratea region in Attica has been the centre of widespread and violent clashes between inhabitants and police for over three weeks. Villagers in Ovriokastro have fought standing battles, blocked roads,beseiged the local police station and set fire to patrol cars in an effort to block the construction of a rubbish dump in the area. In reply riot police units have repeatedly employed tear gas, plastic bullets and water canon in an attempt to allow building to go ahead."
"Bad dog!"
"It took a lot of forgiving in the beginning. I’d forgive, and then an hour later, I’d find myself thinking bitter thoughts, so I’d forgive again. Sort of like washing my hair. You know: lather, rinse, repeat. Only this was: forgive, release, repeat. Finally, I could go half a day, then a whole day. It takes practice, but it is so worth it. I certainly did not want to feel connected to my abuser(s). I learned how great it felt to be free, so I became committed to forgiveness. Now I practice it as a regular part of my life to keep my friendships in good shape and to release myself from bitter thoughts."
"When I look up the most common misspelling of my name, Reginald Shepard, which people sometimes insist upon even when they’re publishing or paying me, no matter how many times I sign and print the correct spelling of my name, besides finding various references to my misspelled self (I try to correct them when I can), I also find references to a death row inmate in Florida by that name. I don’t know what his crime was, but I imagine that it was probably murder. I find it a little disturbing to once again have a criminal doppelganger living (though who knows for how long) in the same state. At least there are two crucial letters separating my name from his, his fate from mine. But still…"

"Okay, that part is a vague and convoluted and, let me say dark, so I will try my best to sum it up without giving too much away. Rubashov is a Party frontrunner who is accused of leading oppositional turbulence and of plotting the murder of No. 1, another frontrunner. Who this No. 1 is, I do not know his name yet. In fact, some of the characters here are named after numbers, based on their prison cell numbers. Rubashov is No. 404, but of course, he is never referred to as that. His neighbors are not 403 and 405, but 402 and 406. So you see, odd-numbered cells stay on one side and across them are the even-numbered ones."
"Psychedelics or hallucinogens are mind-altering drugs capable of inducing distorted perceptions of thought, often including intense sensual input with diminished control of the induced experience.

"""To Paris With Love"" was a new clear stamp set released last month. The set includes the beautiful collage, five sentiments, and three other detail elements. Some soft color was added to a piece of Vintage Cream card stock by smearing Antique Linen, Spun Sugar, and Victorian Velvet Distress inks onto a non-stick mat. These were spritzed with water and the card stock was dabbed into the color several times, then dried with a heat gun. The Paris collage was stamped using Versafine Onyx Black ink. Some zig-zag and straight stitching were used to attach the light pink and tan patterned papers to kraft card stock and everything was layered onto a Vintage Cream card base. The corners of the image were stamped on some pink patterned paper, cut out and popped up in the bottom corners. A little lace, a punched border, some pearls, and a mulberry flower finish the card. This set makes it easy to create elegant cards for your friends and family!"

"My birthday was last Tuesday, so I invited people to come to a café called Café y Té (which means coffee and tea). A few of us gobbled down some of their tasty desserts and we had a good time chatting. They sang Happy Birthday and for a few seconds during the tune, my friend Cecilia was singing in Chinese and Jo and Freddy were singing in Spanish while the English version continued. :) Later some of us went to a bar called Bambu and got some tapas and drinks. After we ordered our drinks I looked around and laughed...here I was at the bar on my 21st birthday and I was the only one out of the 8 that wasn't drinking alcohol. Haha!

The butter is what you taste first and then you get the sticky salty bites of the fish roe and finally you are left with the flavors of the actual roe (slightly fishy). Yes it gets in your molars and yes you will continue to taste that roe so if you aren’t into bottarga, this might be a bit intense for you. I loved it."

Their Fondente gelato is to die for, it’s ice cream that tastes like ganache! If it wasn’t for my utter disability to make decisions I never would have tried this flavor. Since I can never decide what to get (because it all looks so amazing….) I have started asking all the workers what their favorite is, “Quale la sua preferita?”. So far this has worked out fantastic. Who would have ever thought that creamed rice gelato would be good!? I also managed to get a very delicious beer from the girl that works at the Irish Pub using this method.

"It’s all too easy to find ourselves feeling overly busy, and yet often the intention behind our tendency to fill up life’s cup is strikingly beautiful. We want to live lives that matter and to make the most of our time here, and we want to show up fully for the things we care about while also tending to our responsibilities. In Thoreau’s words, “we want to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life … And not, when we come to die, discover that we have not lived.” Possibly, these desires are a different version of the impulse that calls forth the budding leaves and the blossoming flowers at this time of year. I know for myself, when I reconnect with my reasons for overfilling my cup, I have more tolerance— sometimes even gratitude— for the tension created between my desire to tend deeply to what I care about and my desire to have enough space so that I can truly offer my presence to these things."

"Ron Paul has expressed for decades his belief that we ought to be far more careful about how we run our foreign policy and I think he makes a valid point. Our country is indeed broke, as Paul always reiterates and we seem to think that we do need to be the policeman of the world. Should we step back from this role? Or maybe more appropriately, will this break our back? In conjunction with these questions, maybe we ought to ask whether we have defined our enemy appropriately. Does Iran want to blow up Israel (and by accident the Palestinians) with a nuclear weapon or is Iran only trying to defend itself? And are our freedoms threatened by the jihadis or are they mad at our foreign policy? And should our foreign policy be changed based upon new conclusions? I pose these questions to my fellow conservatives with hope that you will at least give them careful thought."
"Today’s society is fast paced and full of busyness. But what are we busy doing? Is it trying to live life with a mission to better ourselves? Any of us who have tried to live this kind of life know that we are never satisfied even when we achieve our goals. Friend, if we have a relationship with Jesus, is it not for us to know justice? If we claim to be a follower of Jesus, we have a responsibility to live a Godly life everywhere we go. God has showed us that life is not about us, it’s about knowing Him, loving Him and loving others. If anyone should know that, it is the body of Christ–those who have been forgiven of their sins. Now that God has blessed us with His forgiveness, He desires that we share His love with others. The world needs us to be an example of living the Bible so that they too are drawn to Christ. They need answers, and for us to say we are “Christians” and live our life in pursuit of personal gain would only be a contradiction to who we say we follow."

I really felt for Hannah because I once broke my ankle, and being stuck at home tends to a person rather grumpy. Stella goes a long way in cheering her up - until she vanishes. My stomach turned over at that scene, because I once lost a zebra finch out of it's cage in my room. Losing a pet is horrible. Cara didn't realise it, but I guessed that her mother would know which steps to take to try and get Stella back. Even though I knew what the ending would be, I still had tears in my eyes.

"This somewhat justifies our suspicion of the material that our shadow functions bring to our attention. It is ambiguous and often difficult to sort out. Whether in dreams, longings, errant thoughts, or technicolor visions, they provide information that is an admixture of light and obscurity. Still, in sorting through it, we come closer to the world around us. To some extent, the confusion of the shadow function’s productions has much to do with the conflict between the order imposed by our conscious functions and the more complex order/disorder that defines the world itself."

But I would not have been passionate about it, and 450 people who flew to San Diego to have a good time would have been bored to tears right off the bat, because they would have seen a speaker who was faking it, and that just didn’t seem right. So I course corrected, and asked Flo if I could change the subject to something I AM passionate about - - - passions. Flo, being the amazing woman she is, said “Of course, silly.” And so here we are."

It was such a last minute thing, I got confirmation of entry the afternoon before the event. Well it ended up being a really fun time. I enjoyed most of it and it's been too long since I ran my last marathon. The last time I entered a marathon was back in 2004, quite some time. The idea was to run with Jen and pace for the entire race. I'm not in racing shape but I knew I could complete the distance without killing myself. Her goal was to come in under 4 hours which was within my capabilities."

While some communities take the approach of re-branding existing efforts to contort themselves into a creative placemaking mold (particularly when there’s grant money on the table), Salem, MA appears to be responding particularly proactively. That North Shore city of some 40,000 just received a $25,000 grant through the “Our Town” program of the National Endowment for the Arts (an opportunity we posted in January’s newsletter) to fund a public art master plan.

"On Sunday morning I poured a cup of coffee and cracked the slender spine of Julian Barnes's 2011 Man Booker Prize-winner The Sense of An Ending. I read it in one sitting, and at a compact, piercing 160 pages, I'm sure I'm not alone; one is likely to gobble it up in one forkful if one cottons well to English schoolboy nostalgia, the vexations, yearnings and botched sexual encounters of the young, the pithy meditations on regret of the old, and the best eff-you letter to an ex-lover I've ever read in any work of fiction (page 104)."

It felt like the one time I could believe that the Earth is round, and it belonged to me. That kind of beauty, or rather the attempt to analyse it, can drive a person crazy. It’s like, this beauty can only be evidence of a God. And now that we have evidence, we have no need for faith – so in the face of certainty what is left for us but insanity?"

Not that I'd advise you to have a go yourself; aside from the disapproving clergy, there're things down there that'd rip your face off, before you even realised you where in danger."
"As promised- here is some information about my class store! But first some background: I decided to use a reward system for my behavior plan the first year I taught kindergarten. Basically the kids earned pennies for doing good things like neat work, helping clean-up, working quietly, bringing in homework, etc. They also lost pennies for breaking class rules. I always explained it to them that just like moms and dads have jobs- kids have jobs too. As kindergartners their job was to be a good listener, be a kind friend, and do great work. Moms and Dads get paid when they do their job, and in our classroom kindergartners get paid for doing their job. Every other Friday we open p our class store for students to use their hard-earned pennies. They love this! And I love the class store because it gives my students great practice with counting, identifying coins, making fair trades for nickels and dimes, making change, making good consumer choices, and spending/saving."

"My story Casey was found to be reminiscent of James Joyce (in the beginning), Edgar Alan Poe (in the middle) and Stephen King (at the end), however when I analysed the entire story, it was found to be James Joyce-ian. I do a lot of practice writing. In fact, practice writing is pretty much all I do. So, I went through all the bits and pieces of writing I had saved on my computer, even when there were just few random paragraphs here and there and put them all through the I Write Like algorithm. I was surprised to get some consistent results. There was a definite prevalence of Joyce, followed by King and Lovecraft when it came to stories and anything from Dan Brown to Chuck Palahniuk for other bits of writing. Mostly Joyce though (although once Vonnegut and Orwell but I'm sure that was a fluke) and occasionally Lovecraft and King. Now, I find all three of those writers completely unreadable which leads me to believe that my writing is completely and utterly crap. It also leads me to believe that I need to drag my writing by the scruff of its neck into the 21st century (when Sir Terry Pratchett will show up as my right and proper writing influence). However, as I've already posited that this test is not to be taken seriously under any circumstances, I breathe a sigh of relief and carry on as usual."

Trouble was, I was such an innocent, I had absolutely no idea what actually did happen. Mechanics and things. The ins and outs. (Sorry). Thus, in my first novel, each"

"I need therapy. Seriously. I love to shop at King Arthur online. This store is my toy store. I have been slowly accumulating their products, and have been experimenting with them. I discovered that the Vital Wheat Gluten really helped my Pioneer Woman Buttered Rosemary Rolls to rise beautifully. The three products that you see pictured above, were going on a maiden voyage for this recipe I'm about to show you. I've used Fleishmann's Rapid Rise Yeast for ages. I decided to buy a bag of SAF Instant yeast, since bread bakers rave about it. Enough product talk... let's talk about yeast. The SAF Instant yeast is supposed to not need any kind of ""proofing"". That translates, simply, into dissolving the yeast with some sort of sugar-- honey or sugar, for example and waiting for it to ""foam"". I think people are afraid of killing the yeast. One more important thing-- I store my yeast in the refrigerator (some people use the freezer) and check the expiration date! Yeast should be live!"

"I have to share with you this insanely delicious, absurdly simple way to cook winter squash. Once again what I'm giving you is a recipe adapted from a Mark Bittman recipe (he calls it Roasted Winter Squash Slices), and I'm sure you get it by now - Bittman makes great, simple recipes we should all cook all the time... but I feel the need to share this in particular because the recipe says ""oil or melted butter"" and if you're anything like me, you usually opt for oil when given the choice between the two, especially for oven roasting. But I'm here to say, forget the oil for once, TRY THE BUTTER! It is COMPLETELY different from roasting in olive oil. The butter - it browns! and turns nutty and fragrant in the oven during the roasting time, and I've never tasted more complex, rich, delicious squash flavor. I'm also going to tell you about a version of a crustless spinach quiche my friend Emily recommended (which she adapted from a recipe on Smitten Kitchen), and which we ate together with the squash for a very delicious eat-the-rainbow type vegetarian meal."

"Finally, we got our entrée: Chicken Vindaloo! Beautifully cooked chicken smothered in a spicy tomato sauce that had just the right amount of kick to it (of course, we like it pretty spicy). Chunks of potato were mixed in, too, giving this dish some nice contrast. We poured this on top of the rice they gave us and, once again, we were in nirvana with Lord Ganesh by our side. With the Vindaloo, we also ordered the garlic spinach–a light and creamy puree mixed in with cumin and other spices. Kristien dipped the hell out of everything in sight into the cucumber yogurt side which was cool, refreshing, and oh so cucumbery. Last of all, we enjoyed the walnut and raisin naan. The naan was baked so well and came out crispy, yet doughy. The walnut taste was great and took over the dish, but we wanted more raisins to balance things out."
"I liked this novel of Sara Bennett. It was something different. I have read so far many romance novels. Yes this one had the typical undying love but they couldn’t be together. But this time it was because the man wasn’t good enough. He was lower than her which was different. But the thing I thought was fascinating about this novel was that Portia took it upon herself to find what she needed and that was all she wanted, and she didn’t linger. She knew what was at cost. It was the man who couldn’t stop, he wanted her and only her. He wasn’t able to give her up."

"Ultimately, though, the films come down to something of a comparison between the differing acting styles of Lon Chaney, in one of his final screen appearances, and Walter Huston. There's no doubting the physical commitment of either actor, although Chaney is particularly arresting as he drops, animal-like, down the rope that leads to his sleeping area. He allows his withered legs to drop before him, before slinging the useless limbs one by one into a wheelchair: it's a fascinating bit of physical acting, which Browning repeats a number of times with variations. Chaney achieves an entirely different, subtler effect in the key scene where he realizes just how mis-guided his vengeance has been; the transition on his face from feral outrage to heartbroken sorrow is extraordinarily multi-layered, and no speeches from Huston in the later version can hold a candle to the intensity of the moment."

"How many times have we seen this in real life? Think of all the people who make decisions based on a desire to get rich, and “pierce themselves with many sorrows”. There are hundreds of examples, from the people who choose careers based on the money and are chained to working 80 hour weeks at jobs that aren’t fulfilling, to gambling addicts, to shopaholics, to plain old thieves–the list goes on and on. But we also don’t want to react in fear to these possibilities, and run away from money. We need to start with being content and accept whatever God has for us, learning how to steward the amount He has given each of us. I used to think it was wrong for Christians to be wealthy, often hearing Mark 10:25 repeating in my head:"

"I think your point may have been this: African-Americans cannot be racist, in America, because they are not in a position to oppress people. This “third common element of all oppression” assumes that people must be white in order to be in a position of oppressing others. But we have only begged the question: says who? Yes, the encyclopedia entry cites a number of sources but, again, I shouldn’t have to read a book in an effort to figure out why you made that comment on my paper. I think you can surely point me to specific authority, specific pages, that would provide a solid basis for such a sweeping assertion that, so far, appears to be somewhat mistaken."

". . . A claim of dilution applies only to purely commercial speech. Mattel, 353 F.3d at 812. See also Bolger, 463 U.S. at 66-67 (finding that materials do not become “commercial speech” simply because the author had economic motivation to create them). “The question whether an economic motive existed is more than a question whether there was an economic incentive for the speaker to make the speech; the Bolger test also requires that the speaker acted substantially out of economic motivation.” Procter & Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., 242 F.3d 539, 552-53 (5th Cir. 2001) (emphasis supplied). “Thus, for example, speech that is principally based on religious or political convictions, but which may also benefit the speaker economically, would fall short of the requirement that the speech was economically motivated” and therefore would be considered noncommercial.

Ancient Russian proverb states: “First blin comes out as a lump”. There is a lot of truth to that – first blin is lumpy – pale, thick, unappetizing. First blini give an indication as to how much dough to use in order for blini to come out straight and thin."

It’s soaking wet and from the way my arm feels, I think its cutting off circulation. It was so hard to get off. I tried to hold my straw and I couldn’t – I dropped it and Beth told me I did. I knew I did but I couldn’t hold it. It is from here that I never see Beth again."
"The same is true of our relationship to God. He gives us the general overview of the plan for our future: 1) If you are a Christian, God will progressively make you more like Jesus. 2) Either you will die and go to heaven first or Jesus will return to to collect you. 3) He will give you a new body and create a new world where you will worship Him in perfect faithfulness. This overview leaves a ton of details unknown, and sometimes that lack of information drives us to worry, fear, and anger. But in those times we must remind ourselves who has made this plan. It is the God loves us as He loves Jesus, who is in absolute control, who is completely trustworthy,who plans everything for our good, and who will never let anything separate us from His love. This knowledge does not need the details of the plan to bring us rest and peace."

I’ve probably known that it was time to get into a different size for a few weeks, but I didn’t want to test that theory in case I was wrong. Who needs dressing room heartache? Luckily Momma Bear was here and helped encourage me to get my little buns in the dressing room and try on some jeans…in a smaller size. So after digging through a massive amount of jeans not in my size, I found a pair to try on in my suspected new size. But I still didn’t trust myself, so I brought in the old size as well. At least I would have a backup that fit somewhat…"

"Later, money became pieces of paper. They would consist of either words, stating that the bearer of this piece of paper was owed $100.00 worth of gold for example, and the holder could trade this paper with someone (usually a bank) for gold. After a while, specifically in the USA, the gold reserves were full, yet the people claimed they needed more money. The government decided to do away with “paper Vs. gold reserves” and simply printed more paper money, effectively devaluing all currency of America. The American money is now simply a piece of paper, stating its worth of X dollars. All of their paper currency is the same size, same colour and to a blind person, has no obvious differences from each other. Completely worthless, in my opinion, and literally, not worth the paper it is printed on!"

"I wouldn’t think so. I can think, however, of other reasons to be thus rejected. Take the case of James Salter. He is indeed a good—but surely not too good—writer, which could be resented and rejected by writers conspicuously less good, envious and exclusionary. Bernard Shaw wittily entitled one of his plays with the reversal of that formula, Too True to Be Good. So Salter may be too true a writer, or even too truthful a person, to be tolerated by lesser writers afraid of his calling their bluff, questioning their exaggerated self-esteem."

It was a difficult balancing act. Development done right, gentle on the environment and drawing tourists in manageable numbers could help protect sharks and their ecosystem. Tom knew that. But too much development, like they had in the ’eighties at Freeport in Grand Bahama and Paradise Island in Nassau, would destroy them."

"While in college, I worked at the concession stand of the movie theater at Bellis Fair Mall. Our concession stand was a little spartan. We had no nachos, pizza by the slice, or even coffee. We did have hotdogs, cooked to perfection on a roller grill. Customers rarely ordered a hotdog, so we usually had a few extra at the end of the night. These dogs had been cooking all day, 10 hours or so. I can still hear the sound of the grill, rolling up and down, and see the hotdogs glistening in their own grease. The skin was delightfully tough and rubbery, while the middle was hot and juicy. Because we usually cleaned the roller grill with Sprite, the dogs were enhanced by a sugary, lemon-lime film. Enjoying a purloined wiener in the back room was pure ecstasy. It wasn’t really stealing. The hotdogs had to be disposed of at the end of the night. As lovely as they tasted after cooking one full day, I doubt a second day on the grill would improve them much. Ah…I believe my love affair with hotdogs began there, among the boxes of soda syrup in the back room."

"Good question Charlotte, and well-phrased. There is a battle royal going on between Dawkins and the Creationists indeed, and it is important to realise that Dawkins does not = science, and Creationism does not = religion. Both are at the exclusivist ends of their own spectrum. Dawkinsism does not just applaud the theory of evolution, with which a majority of Christians probably agree, but seeks to denigrate religion as something at best infantile and at worst dangerous that should be got rid of. Creationism is not the doctrine of believing that the universe has a Creator, that many scientists have and do subscribe to, but the particular and rather peculiar idea – at least in some forms – that the world in its present configuration of species was made just so by God and what looks like evolution is not really that at all."

The color, the layout, the genius use of FLOR tiles...it was all her.

"Children do love stories about children who are even naughtier than themselves. Go to a primary school on their Dressing-Up As A Children's Book Character Day, and you always bump in to multiple Pippi Longstockings and Horrid Henrys. Well, there's a new kid on the block as far as fictional naughty children go, and her name is Martha Bones. As a middle child myself, I relate to Martha, loathing her goody-goody older sister, jealous of her can-do-nothing-wrong baby brother, vying with friend/enemy next door, but expressing all those familiar feelings in such joyously REALLY NAUGHTY ways (she bit Father Christmas, for goodness sake!) that she's a real pleasure to read about. It's Martha's view of events that we get, and we very quickly realise that her views are somewhat prejudiced. A few sentences into the story we are told - 'It wasn't fair, she thought. anybody could accidentally drop their sister's library book down the toilet. And then pull the flush. anybody could accidentally write Baby For Sale accross their baby brother's head. In green felt-tip. The Non-Wash-Offable kind.' Isn't that escalating of naughtiness to the point of wickedness delicious?! But a reluctant and incompetent Interstellar Agent (an updated form of Guardian Angel) called Fred is soon doing battle to make Martha good. The results of their tussle are fast-moving and slapstick, with situations all too familar from real family life, but taken here to enjoyable extreme. But this isn't just a comic romp of a book; it also lightly explores something of the complexities of goodness and badness to show that things aren't always black and white, and that adults as well as children struggle with goodness."
"I was surprised to find squad based controls. It’s not overly complex or anything like that, but it’s handy to have in addition to relying on yourself. The game teaches you how to direct a squad mate to target a specific enemy or perform a certain task. It’s really easy to pull off with everything being controlled by the right shoulder button. It’s a neat feature and a welcomed surprise. Still, the enemies in the demo didn’t seem to be overly intelligent but at least would try to have some self preservation as they hid behind cover and moved to a better vantage point. I didn’t have too much trouble through the demo."

The victims were also armed with 9mm Norinco pistols, and had managed to fire a few shots back at their attackers. Their evidence also had to be collected for ballistic examination. I had scratched around on many occasions in pools of thick fresh blood looking for spent cartridge cases and bullets, but on that specific night I didn’t feel like doing it! I really had to force myself to stay focused. It was dark but the scene was well lit with huge spotlights placed in strategic positions. The scene was also well cordoned off. I noticed a large group of high-ranking Black police officials standing behind the yellow police barrier tape. It was quite obvious that they were eagerly waiting for me to finish my examination and to deliver a preliminary report."

"And it is, of course, wrong to cost all blame on outside forces. I keep a copy of John G. Saxe’s poem The Blind Men and the Elephant and realize how many entities within colleges don’t see the whole picture. Encased in silos with limited vision, they feel the tusk and sense a spear, feel the leg and imagine a tree, feel the ear and envision a fan. And miss the elephant in the room, which is that only by working together can colleges best serve their students."
"She stared in horror as a crack appeared between her feet, ran across the floor, up the wall and onto the ceiling.

"It’s a catch-22: we want Callahan to do what he does to people like Scorpio, indeed we can even justify it, but we also want the court system to reprimand cops for disregarding the cases of Miranda and Escobido. The film is wise to drop those names in the scene that follows the one from the football field where, once again, gets the audience firmly behind the anti-hero Callahan as he vents his frustrations at the bureaucratic ridiculousness of City Hall as the mayor claims that Scorpio, once out of the hospital, will walk a free man because his rights were taken from him. Callahan, through clenched teeth (of course), asks the mayor about the kidnapped girl’s rights. It ultimately culminates in the mayor letting Harry know that the gun used as the murder weapon in all of the rooftop sniper killings is inadmissible as evidence because, “it’s the law.” Harry response of, “Well then the law’s crazy!” is a scene that no doubt elicited a lot of head-nodding and “amens” from everyone who watched it in 1971, a time of great tension and tumultuousness (and would probably get the same reaction were it shown in theaters today); yet, the individual that critically thinks about the situation clearly understands that Harry was in the wrong even though Scorpio is the bad guy. I think what makes Dirty Harry so effective and popular even today is the way the mood of politically correct America in the 2000s can still be applied to a film that was made in 1971 and was about the mood of America in the ‘60s."

"When my babies were about 7 or 8 months old I guess, my mother-in-law came by for a visit, and while she was here enjoying playing with the babies on their little play mat, she said, “How do you get anything done? If I were you, I’d just want to play with babies all day!” It was an affectionate comment…with an unintended consequence. I immediately had lots of doubts: “I don’t want to play with them all day. Does that mean I am too detached? Selfish? Would a normal parent want to play with their babies all day?“"

"1909-1919 When the company that was to be known as Gulf was born in 1901 with an oil discovery in Spindletop, Texas, the primary commercial fuel was coal. By 1903, the age of mechanization had arrived and it was now up to the petroleum industry to keep pace, for the age could not proceed without it. Gasoline development, into which Gulf invested millions of dollars, responded to advances in automotive technology to make the modern motorcar possible. Within a dozen years of Spindletop, Gulf scored notable firsts with the world’s first drive-in service station, complimentary Gulf road maps and over water drilling at Ferry Lake. In 1917, the Gulfstream went into World War I service, along with the rest of Gulf’s tanker fleet."

Indeed, I couldn't invent it – I had tried. Any plot or situation I invented was tired, trite, and petered out for lack of enthusiasm on my part. The best writing always came 'out of the blue'.

This opens from the 21th January at the Institute in Somerset House in London - but being a working college it is only open to the public on the last Saturday of each month. If you want to catch the show though, it runs until June 2013, which should give you plenty of opportunity. I have a mix of older and newer work in the show, including the image above, taken near Somerset house at the end of last year.

"Our first stop was Gymboree, where bathing suits were on sale for $9.99. The girls fit into size 4T bathing suits now. (Although, when Allie tried hers on at home, the sides up top were big. I may return it.) I also found 1 pair of shorts on clearance in size 4T. There were hardly any 4T items left in the store. We then checked out a ""Mommy and Daddy"" store. 7 For All Mankind. The last pair of jeans I purchased was for $10 from the clearance rack located at the back of the Gap outlet store. They were too long so I chopped the bottoms off and they have now frayed into semi-floods. I managed to find a pair of new jeans for $50 and they were the softest, most comfortable pair of jeans I have ever tried on so I bought them. Unfortunately, I am not 6 feet tall so I need to remove 8 inches or so from the bottom."
"Let’s look a bit more closely at why and how this works. For Nietzsche, the apparent self-negation of asceticism is illusory – it’s actually a self-affirmation. What has happened is simply that ‘self’ has been redefined: now the self that denies ‘others’ the self that is denied. A faster, for example, identifies themselves with that force, that will, which is triumphing over hunger – the will to food is treated as a subordinate, an alien will to be conquered. In doing so, suffering is not avoided – for the person does not cease to feel the hunger, they cannot deny the fact that it remains their hunger even if they deny it – but now that suffering can be given meaning, can be turned into gratification. Asceticism thus allows suffering to be converted into a sense of power."

"The gentleman I took the class from has a unique perspective on family. He grew up in an orphanage run by Catholic Nuns. He had an older brother who was in a different section of the orphanage. On occasion, his mother would come visit him for a weekend, he says when her conscience got the better of her. So, even in the pecking order of the orphanage, he wasn't a ""true"" orphan, because he had a mother. She just didn't want to visit very often. So, the better socks and clothes went to the ""true"" orphans, the ones who had no one."
"Mick has fallen in love with music and in spite of never really having had any kind of musical training, begins to compose in notebooks that she keeps hidden in a hat box under her bed. When she thinks of her attraction to music, she thinks of it as being in her inside room--the place where only she may venture and the place where she stores her insights into life, and the place where she is who she was meant to be. Quite simply, a place separate from ego. Because of her family's extreme poverty she has to begin working while still in high school and with the overtime hours she finds all her energy invested in the work of a sales girl, to the point that when she gets home the music no longer comes to her."

In only a few weeks, she would be working in Paris. She would be able to see her brother more often and would be able to soak up a different culture. It seemed like a dream and she was so caught up in it that she didn’t care about all the work she still had to do—the crash course in French, even though it was a British firm she was going to work for and there would be English speakers there, all the packing and things she had to arrange."

Also the power companies got a lot of heat for being slow in getting power back on, and not spending enough to prevent storm damage to their installations. But the society did not fall apart."

But there is no way this team can compete with the elite in the NBA without their superstar. They cannot possibly expect Luol Deng, Carlos Boozer, Richard Hamilton, and Joakim Noah to hold their own over a 7-game series with the Heat. If Rose plays like the MVP he was last season, it is a completely different story. If that were to happen, the Bulls become my favorite to win it all with one of the three players most capable of taking over a game and a stingy defense."

"But let's back up just a little shall we? Say....30-35 years or so. You see, the only evergreens that grow in this part of Alabama are either pines or cedars. Now, when I was a child we always had a cedar tree. They grew prolifically on our land and if we couldn't find a suitable one there, our neighbors would always welcome us to look on their land for one to cut. From what I remember we always had a good time, going out to choose the tree. Sometimes we would even hitch the horse to a little sleigh-like contraption we had. We would all ride on the way over and then let the tree ride back to the house so it would not get torn up from being dragged. And we were happy with our cedar tree...until we got older. Then we began to see what other people had and what they had in town and our little minds began to turn and we began to think that maybe what we had wasn't good enough. And sure enough, it wasn't long before the unspoken truth crystallized in our minds. Cedar trees were what poor people had for Christmas trees. Now, we were by no means wealthy but we were not what I would call poor, but God knows, Christmas is certainly THE time to keep up all those appearances, so we confided to our parents that we needed a ""bought"" tree. You know, one of the real Christmas trees, the Frasier firs, even a Douglas fir! Anything but the homely, scrawny little ""corndogs"" as we so derisively began to call the cedars. I suppose in the spirit of the season, or the spirit of just getting us to shut up, our parents went along with us and from then on we had our bought tree. Smug in our self satisfaction and conformity we all carried this on into adulthood and I must sadly admit it has been my one weakness, my one last holdout in my personal Christmas vigil against the rampant consumerism. Boycott Black Friday? Of course! Handmade presents? Certainly! Have a local, native, unendangered tree? Uuhhh, I think I smell the ham burning, excuse me please...Oh, I've used every excuse in the book; 'the firs are so pretty and they look like what a Christmas tree is supposed to look like!' 'I'm supporting a local merchant by buying one' and on and on and on. But it all comes back to that little unspoken suggestion I learned as a child by observing, a little too closely, what other people have. Cedar trees are what poor people have for Christmas trees. In all of my unconventional life spent thumbing my nose at what society thought, I could not admit to myself my true aversion to this simple thing. This simple and stupid thing."

"Horror Express was a Spanish production directed by Eugenio Martin. It was filmed in Madrid in the years 1971-1972, a low budget film ($300,000) with the luxury of having three familiar genre actors in the lead: Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Telly Savalas. The film was co-produced by American filmwriter/producer Bernard Gordon, who had collaborated with Martin on the 1972 film Pancho Villa (which also featured Savalas in the title role). The filmmakers used both the miniature train and interior train set from Pancho Villa for Horror Express. The challenge was that they only had one set to be used as an interior train car. All of the scenes for each train car had to be shot at once, then the set would be rebuilt as the next car."
"At this point I would have paid $1000 to make this problem go away so I texted a couple friends to get the numbers of people they'd used, actual professionals, who knew what the hell they were doing. One of these friends even came to my house armed with some of her supplies. Now THAT'S a friend! It meant the world to me. In the meantime I made an appointment with ""The Lice Lady of Westchester"" for the following morning. She told me over the phone exactly what I needed to do at home and talked me down from the ledge. I went to bed, feeling icky still, but hopeful for the first time in hours."
"One of the strangest things about the night was that I counted at least four songs with strong allusions to God, or Jesus, if not being completely about Christianity, and sandwiched right in the middle of them was the song about shooting a man in the head. And he sang every one of them without a hint of irony. Without a single inclination that the songs might be the least bit conflicting. God bless Texas, I guess."
"Poor Leila happened to send me an email right around that time, with information about St Colette. It was a witness story of a woman's prayers being answered for conception through the intercession of St Colette. That email came at the WRONG time. I believe I responded with something along the lines of, ""Oh, thanks. That's nice. I'm so glad her prayers for ANOTHER child were answered. But her story is nothing like mine, and there is no miracle in store for me. Thanks again."""
"Nevertheless it will be impossible to be convinced these are all cause-and-affect relationships. Someone that goes with a vegan diet plan could be understood is quite in tuned with his diet and thus, his health. Is that person being compared to a non-vegetarian who doesn’t give his diet another consideration? To explain, if an individual maintained the Mediterranean Diet Plan which included lean meat, fish and animal byproducts that were actually healthful and avoided animal byproducts that weren’t healthy, how would he compare statistically to individuals using a vegan diet. I haven’t been able to locate information that are specific for that group comparison, and lacking one I’d believe that statistics are often misleading."

This shows the Cruden set up does fully replicate the vehicle dynamics and driving experience. You’re not simply driving a faster version of the lower formula car model."

"Few things in the world are as perfect as a properly made Corpse Reviver No. 2. The only down side is that few things haven't been said about it--this libation is one of the darlings of the cocktail community. From its history to the individual ingredients to the ways those ingredients have changed, thus forever altering the landscape of the beverage, almost every iota of information related to the Corpse Reviver No. 2 has been exposed or unearthed. And why not? It is a wondrous libation. With its four main ingredients in equal portions not only is it elegant and refined, but also easy to remember. And while the intricacy of the flavors is a key part of its success, the touch of absinthe is what truly showcases the beauty of restraint that the Corpse 2 symbolizes. That little hint of anise is where balance is found."

"Yet I like to think that ""parody"" doesn't necessarily have to be funny, but can be homage or critique as well. My parodies are loose ones - and I've deliberately not mentioned the poet I'm thinking of in each one (they are well known ones, and not necessarily ones I've read that much.) What struck me in writing this series was how ""parody"" is a little like Mike Yarwood or Rory Bremner's impressions. You don't necessarily know the parodied writer that well, but there has to be enough of ""signature"" (the equivalent of a facial tic or a particular prop that a Bremner or Yarwood might accentuate) for you to do something ""in the style of"" that is in itself a new poem. There are quite a number of prize winning poets that I'd find it hard to pull out what their USP was. Even with these, I do wonder whether a poem like ""Playing with Guns"" is ""generic Irish poet"" rather than the one I was thinking of."
"My baby boy, my little Wyatt belongs to the Lord. It didn't matter if he lived or died, he still belongs to the Lord. So why was I so selfish to ask him to live while suffering? Because I thought wrong. I thought the way one would if they were living for themselves alone, thinking only of themselves. Today it was brought to my attention that we all live and die for the Lord."
"He has no use for the religion of fear and equally little for social or moral religion. A God who rewards and punishes is inconceivable to him for the simple reason that a man’s actions are determined by necessity, external and internal, so that in God’s eyes he cannot be responsible, any more than an inanimate object is responsible for the motions it undergoes. Science has therefore been charged with undermining morality, but the charge is unjust. A man’s ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hopes of reward after death."

"It was said he was the first person in Europe to have an Apple Mac (Stephen Fry being the second). He was script editor of Doctor Who from 1978 to 1979 during Tom Baker’s craziest period (the two of them hit it off so well they encouraged the most ludicrous behavior in each other). He wrote three Doctor Who stories, including one of the best ever, ever, ever, ‘City of Death’, set in Paris, about an alien who steals the Mona Lisa and gets Leonardo to knock up a few copies in the past so he can sell them to private buyers in the present to fund his experiments.

Just like you, Mr. President, I want to move Nigeria forward. I want to do it in a gentleman’s way – without shedding any sweat. But I have seen that Nigeria is such a heavy load that anyone involved in that venture must be ready to perspire. Despite the impression I must have given over the years as a professional critic, I am a thoughtful man. I know it must be hard being the president of a dysfunctional country like Nigeria. But I did not know it was this hard. And surely, you did not have the slightest idea how hard it would be when you allowed your name on the ballot."

"I originally had thought to leave recruitment relatively open for about 4 weeks, but given the success we’ve had to date, I believe it would not be premature to go ahead and narrow the path to guild membership. This means we will be adopting a new recruitment policy that will effectively suspend open recruitment (i.e., stop actively advertising the guild on the server by directly contacting unguilded potential recruits, and posting guild advertisements to channels like Trade, etc.). Such promotional activities are necessary evils, but I think we have reached a threshold of activity that will allow us to suspend those activities, at least temporarily."

Lilith however came to Adam as he lay asleep and coupled with him in his dreams.

"Public Health is a construct. Individuals have interests, not elected or appointed health authorities. These entities have goals, and they are seldom aligned with the best interests of the public but rather with the political authority that governs their budget and administration.

(Non-Governmental Organization) Smoking Bans are most assuredly not in the best interest of public health but rather in the interests of the pharmaceutical companies manufacturing “Nicotine Replacement Therapies” and the highly questionable NGO’s campaigning for the implementation of Smoking Bans on their behalf."

To be able to show my vocal abilities fully, I needed to practice our country’s ballads’ perfectly, and find a way to express the sensibility found in R&B and soul songs. The thing I was concerned the most about was the way to make my voice tone sound different than the other singers’.”"

"Do you know how it feels to bury a baby you have fed and bathed and cuddled next to you? Do you know how it feels to someone who himself is just a kid? Can you even imagine the pain that slices through the very core of a boy who brought the baby home, made him a part of his own self, shared his energies, his love, joy, sorrow, everything with the little animal companion. I do. Been there done that and to see my boys go through it just left me numb. We tried to put up a brave front, said positive things to each other and in silence of our heart we scream in agony. We broke down , unable to bridge the distance between us and finally our brain shuts off. Sometimes we the live just because of the stumbling breaths we exchange. There is disquiet of quiet all around. Once the first deluge is over , there is a complete disconnect. One wants silence.. complete silence."

As I heard Roger Ebert saying in an old Nightline review, “all movies are special effects, movies are not real.” Of course we all know this and it sounds obvious but, if it’s properly done, we willingly suspend our disbelief. But the more special effects that are thrown at us the harder it is to suspend this disbelief maybe?"
"It has not been an easy road for him. He goes to church when the kids are around sometimes but mostly he has abandoned adherence to the values and principles he was raised on. I fear for him that he has hit his critical stage and given up on himself. In his case he did not rest on his foundation when the trials came he abandoned them. When he could have done something to save his life as he knew it he told me “he couldn’t see it” and did not have faith. And now perhaps he is not able to forgive himself for what he did and is suffering the consequence of his actions. Perhaps God is trying to get his attention through the trials. All I know is I would not want to trade places with him."
"While I’m not a huge sex in the city follower, this one scene from one of the movies keeps running through my mind. Charlotte stops running when she finds out she’s pregnant, even though the doctor said all is well. When Carrie confronts her about it she confesses that she’s scared something bad will happen because she has everything she wants---blissfully married, a child, another on the way, life is filled w/ rainbows and unicorns etc. while one friend got left at the alter, another is talking divorce and a third broke up w/ her long term bf."

"A very close friend has been told he has liver cancer. Keeping it all very much to himself and holding the details back. I don't know whether he is doing this to spare the people around him, as a coping mechanism or whether he just doesn't know himself. Hopefully should know more next week. This is a man who has played a pivotal role in my development as a human being. I met him and his life partner (they don't believe in marriage) when I was pregnant with Peta. Alone in a city where I knew noone, I had hooked up with the most unlikely of guys, and I met this couple through him. They strengthened my belief in my own power to be. They supported me unconditionally through thick and thin. Sort of like parents but better as they are never judgemental. They just encourage you to be who you want to be and fuck the rest of them. It's been a hard blow, I'm preparing for the worst but expecting the best."

"PhitGrips fit snuggly around dumbbell bars, handrails and other type workout equipment. When I first go to the gym, I start my warm-up by walking on the treadmill, and these grips fit nicely around the hand grips, although the heart rate could not be read when using the PhitGrips (not a big deal to me as I stop and take it manually throughout my workout anyhow). I also used them when lifting weights and using other circuit type exercise equipment. They go off and on very quickly, as one side is open, which allows you to simply slap them on and go. With some of the circuit equipment, the grips were wider than the equipment bars, but it didn't seem to matter as my hands held them in place nicely. I am not a power lifter, but even with the light use, I loved how the PhitGrips prevented my hands from callouses from the dumbbells. No need for gloves! I like that they are lightweight and flexible, so I could easily slip them into my pockets until needed."

"Such high admission prices, after all, demonstrate an institutional devaluation of public access to public art collections. In my view, this in turn reflects an institutional devaluation of (a) the idea that anybody and everybody can look at or learn to look at art in a way that is rewarding or helpful to their own enjoyment and well-being; (b) the notion that public collections, by virtue of being held in trust for the public, deserve to be seen freely by the public; and (c) the thought that public arts institutions have a duty (even if it’s a self-interested one) to be engaged in public arts education. Museums and galleries sometimes like to complain that they are being abandoned by an increasingly unpredictable, uneducated and uninterested public. I say, who first abandoned the public and showed a lack of interest in their rights or needs?"

"Now that I live alone, though; now that I’ve reached a plateau, I find myself asking these guys for help many times a day; when shaving in the morning or when brushing at night. Once, there was even a women! Imagine that, a female version of me. She grew her hair to neck length and lingered in front of the mirror to brush the rouge on her cheeks, fuller than my own, and brush the hair she’d cultivated. I began the conversation hushed out of reverence, and she replied low in turn. She told me that although she could see her reflections just as I could, she had never seen a male of her before. She called me handsome and I called her beautiful and we flirted until the point that I had to reach towards her face, but it was cold, cold glass and she didn’t even raise her hand in turn but left out of guilt and I never saw her again. I cried for the first time in years afterwards, cried pathetically until I fell asleep, like I used to do a s a child. What’s worse is that the other reflections don’t believe it happened. I stopped speaking of it once a certain married reflection made too many self-love jokes at my expense."

"An argument which accepts the simple terms of 'readability' versus 'unreadability' seems to me to sidestep the real issue: it accepts books as fixed by one or the other of two immutable (opposed) characteristics. But this is clearly nonsense. We all like different books. Books some of us find boring others don't. A book I might find difficult to read you perhaps won't. Reading is a dynamic process in which a complex array of things come into play: the reader's taste, mood, expectation and, above all, education - by which I don't mean formal schooling but cultural immersion. We can learn to like and understand books or the kinds of books we may not previously have liked or understood. Of course there are different kinds of books: we can also read in different ways, simply for enjoyment and comfort or to be challenged and made to think and have our perceptions overturned, and different books cater for those different experiences."

When I sat down to do our monthly cash flow plan (aka budget) I had a pretty rude awakening.

"Plenty of meat in the newspaper literary pages this weekend, and some to delight the Bitch. Jed Mercurio, flouting Milan Kundera's warning that film adaptations of novels steal their essence, describes with relish in the Guardian the process of doing so (though I'd say not without revealing the odd doubt). However, a posthumous essay from Susan Sontag in the same paper sounds a deeply serious note about the growing encroachment of television culture on novels and on their crucial role in our social and intellectual life. Sontag says: What serves ""the modern"" is standardization, homogenization. (Indeed, ""the modern"" is homogenization, standardization. The quintessential site of the modern is an airport; and all airports are alike, as all new modern cities, from Seoul to São Paulo, tend to look alike.) This pull toward homogenization cannot fail to affect the project of literature. The novel, which is marked by singularity, can only enter this system of maximum diff usion through the agency of translation, which, however necessary, entails a built-in distortion of what the novel is at the deepest level - which is not the communication of information, or even the telling of engaging stories, but the perpetuation of the project of literature itself, with its invitation to develop the kind of inwardness that resists the modern satieties Television distances, she says, whereas novels pay attention and require the reader to do so: I would argue that the mindset [the media] foster and the appetites they feed are entirely inimical to the writing (production) and reading (consumption) of serious literature... On the one hand, we have, through translation and through recycling in the media, the possibility of a greater and greater diffusion of our work. On the other hand, the ideology behind these unprecedented opportunities for diffusion, for translation - the ideology now dominant in what passes for culture in modern societies - is designed to render obsolete the novelist's prophetic and critical, even subversive, task, and that is to deepen and sometimes, as needed, to oppose the common understandings of our fate. These should be words close to the hearts of us novelists but Henry Porter in the Observer suggests that our well-known writers are now colluding with this non-engaged market culture. None is engaging with the urgent issues, he says: ...the widening gap between poor and rich, the seething anger of the underclass, the steady attack on the rights of those who cannot protect themselves, the war in Iraq, the regular deaths of British soldiers in Helmand province, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, rendition. Instead, he says, the widening gap between poor and rich, the seething anger of the underclass, the steady attack on the rights of those who cannot protect themselves, the war in Iraq, the regular deaths of British soldiers in Helmand province, Afghanistan, Guantanamo, rendition. Instead, he says:Nowadays, there seem to be an awful lot of middle-aged blokes dragging their tortured souls around the literary circuit, fretting about their display in Waterstone's."

He brought a lot of new arrangements to the songs and reconstructed some of the pieces that were all over the place.

We have been running out of oil for a very long time, but technology keeps creating new opportunities.

Generally, each floret is oriented toward the next by approximately the golden angle, 137.5°, producing a pattern of interconnecting spirals, where the number of left spirals and the number of right spirals are successive Fibonacci numbers. Typically, there are 34 spirals in one direction and 55 in the other; on a very large sunflower there could be 89 in one direction and 144 in the other. This pattern produces the most efficient packing of seeds within the flower head."

Of course, I was panic stricken as I was totally unprepared and I haven’t seen them for over 10 years and I was a bit annoyed that my weekend routine and errands would have to be postponed. Anyway, we went to a little Bistro restaurant around the corner of my street because that was the only place I knew we could go without an advanced booking."

"Use Trip Advisor ratings (one of the best I think) and similar sites as a guide not as a given. It is not always clear whether every rating is genuine and while I hope they are, it is important to read them with an open mind. I have read scathing reviews of hotels that I love and vice-versa... These sites are not definitive guides but they can offer some insights... and they can also mis-inform...

"People argue that this is due to greater levels of black deprivation and higher levels of poverty, however, again they will be telling lies with statistics, it is certainly true that a higher percentage of the black community, around 26%, live in relative poverty, compared to around 8% of whites, however, presenting statistics based on individual racial group, is the same trick our government and theirs play with the hate crime figures, as it ignores the fact that blacks only account for 12% of the US population, (approx: 38 million) whereas whites are still over 63% (approx: 237 million) hence in numerical terms there are over twice as many whites living in relative poverty than blacks. Hence, if deprivation were the reason, one would expect to see far higher levels of such crimes being committed by whites than we do."

The standings were currently Moscow 1, Kim 0, you could argue. I wasn’t looking to inflict damage on the city to bring the tally to one-all. I only had, somehow, to find the brightly-lit kitchen experience, to discover the human kindness amid the hostile babushki ticket-takers and extortive Red Square policemen. And I had to convince Anna that she could trust me, that I was the right person to help tell her extraordinary life story to Americans. I hoped my tattered Russian was up to the task."

"JC stepped into the Barrio and took over. JC was a big, Irish, redheaded, mother of a man. He’s old school New York and old school Irish-American. He had a Puerto Rican wife and they have two kids together. Now, most of the clubs in New York for their weekend talent fight over the huge – nationally known names – for their weekend lineups. But, not JC, probably because he couldn’t afford them. So, he went with us, middle level acts, sprinkled with a known name here and there. The Barrio was a strange place in that we, the middling acts, were grateful for the weekend stage time, however, we had put those named acts up on a pedestal. Once they started coming in and only doing as well as us middlers, we sort of felt like, “Wait a minute….why are we being paid less and this guy is no where near as good as his resume says…What gives?” It created a real solidarity among us. It was sort of like a baseball player getting pulled up from the minors and going, “Hold on a sec, I’m at least as strong as that outfielder.” We didn’t feel that way about every big act, obviously, but we definitely did about most of them. It unified us and created a brother/ sisterhood of sorts."
"The following questions should be answered before with most everything:"
"What with looking after two children under 3 I don't have a lot of time to brew these days so, in order to finalise my recipes for my new venture, I'm now brewing at night. Last night I racked the last Green Bullet beer (which tastes pretty good) and brewed a fairly standard bitter."
"The last thing I would like to touch on is this... There is a lot of ""information"" available, especially with the internet. Be it how to start solids, how much a child should be eating, anything...you can find several ""rules"" that should be followed. The truth is though, that every parent and every child is different. What works for one child may not work for another. During the time that Lil Man was not gaining, and even losing, weight- I became obsessed with his intake. Weighing him before and after each feeding, tracking the amount and frequency of his intake. Around 4 months of age though he was not fitting the ""requirements"" that I had researched and seen online. I worried a little. At his 6 month appointment I expressed my concerns to his pediatrician. Lil Man was only taking in 20 oz a day. Everywhere said he should be getting at least 24 oz- maybe even more since he was combo fed. The pediatrician looked at me and said ""Your son is perfectly proportionate. If he were to eat any more than he is now, he would probably be overweight for his height. There is no such thing as a ""rule"" when it comes to babies. They are as individual as adults and sometimes we forget that."" So considering the debate on solids at 4 months or wait until 6 months, how much a child should eat until what age, and more....remember, all the research in the world does not mean that is how YOUR child should eat...or someone else's child."
"I ended up playing around with this for a while, trying to get things to look the way I wanted them. A lot of that was, again, sort of a learning-curve thing. My original cover design had a serifed font rather than Pfennig and I didn't like how the results looked in the preview in KDP. As it turns out, the preview in KDP seems to render text poorly compared to almost every other place I saw it. So, the lesson I took from that was that if it looks okay when you shrink it down to thumbnail size in your design tool then it should look fine for most purposes."

"I have been asked many times whether or not I listen to music while writing or reading. I honestly don’t know how anybody could read for long periods of time while listening to music, as it’s far too distracting, but when it comes to writing, it’s a different story. Perhaps it’s because I am so concentrated on writing, that my mind blocks out the lyrics while I try to express myself, often with my feet tapping (or sometimes dancing while sitting – a talent indeed), but it is rare I find myself writing in silence."

"With Classic Constructed, you need to make a Deck (minimum 60 cards, not including your hero) with all the cards that ever came out. Even though this may seem easier than the Core Constructed, personally I don’t think it is. You can actually get the best cards of every set possible and turn them into a really good deck. For a beginning player, I find this really hard as you would need to start buying the specific cards or you need to be able to trade them with someone else (another option is of course buying the boosterboxes if they are still available but this would cost a lot of money)."

"A president's personality comprises a large, but mostly static component of his prestige. The more variable element to his prestige comes from changes in the public image of the presidency, which is to say changes in what the public wants the president to be. These changes are driven by events that affect members of the public, especially negatively, like economic trouble, military conflict, and social unrest. Since presidents have limited influence on such happenings, their prestige depends on their success in managing the hopes of the public. They must teach the public to see their role in a favorable light. But this instruction takes place under four constraints: (1) the public is chronically inattentive, (2) when they are attentive, it is in the context of pressing events not likely to be of the president's choosing, (3) deeds will influence public perception more than words, and (4) how the public understands the president will be influenced by the context of what he has previously done and said. In other words, both events and his own record will compete with the president's attempts to shape public perceptions."

"Facts are facts, and McBride’s insinuation that “context” could somehow transform Murphy’s factual errors into “facts” is absurd. But context does matter in interpreting factual errors. That Murphy’s factual errors weren’t random but almost always tilted against the lacrosse players suggests she wasn’t simply amazingly sloppy (a problem that in and of itself would seem to disqualify someone as a Poynter source or seminar instructor). Instead, Murphy’s fabrications bolstered her preconceived views, suggesting deliberateness to her fabrications."

The fear of stomach cancer, which had killed her precious mother, was all she was concerned with. However, she was relived when the doctor told her it wasn’t cancer. Connie was pregnant with a menopause baby. In the shadow of Patch mountain, God seems to hold the blessings back until we deserve them. The news was alarming to Gary. He didn’t know if he was being blessed or cursed. He couldn’t believe they were finally going to be blessed with a baby. Both Gary and Connie were completely flabbergasted."

"Northwest of Wrangell are the DeLong Islands, named for George Washington DeLong, the captain of USS Jeannette. Also in 1881, he discovered and claimed these three islands for the United States. He named them for the voyage co-sponsor, New York City newspaper publisher James Gordon Bennett. The ship’s crew received a hero’s welcome back in Washington, and Congress awarded them gold medals."
"Warmists and skeptics alike know that eddying ocean currents in the Pacific have a big influence on temperatures and precipitation in Pacific-bordering countries and elsewhere. The two major eddies are customarily dubbed el nino and la nina. So Warmists want to point to them as having a slowly increasing cooling influence to offset an underlying slow warming over the last 15 years. And the article below tries to put bones on that unlikely theory."
"The Chi Machine® maximizes the movement of the body which helps to provide prompt temporary relief through increased Oxygen levels. It temporarily relieves minor muscle aches, pains, and tension caused by fatigue or overexertion and it also temporarily increases local blood circulation. It supports the temporary relief from these conditions without creating undue stress to bodily structure or additional muscular overexertion. It is wonderful for individuals who through age or physical limitations cannot exercise."
"The boys here are the sons of criminals – murderers, perhaps, or men and women that couldn’t pay their taxes. Some of the boys might even be criminals themselves, arrested by the military for smaller offenses – something simple like petty theft or breaking curfew. It doesn’t matter what the offense is. Once a citizen of our satellite breaks any military law, they relinquish their rights and are sold as slaves. Those who commit particularly offensive crimes have a choice between execution and the labor camps beyond the great barrier wall."

"Austin stopped by for a visit and tour of the garden, on his way south. He's not been here before and we enjoyed getting to visit. He's off on an adventure, hoping to learn about oyster and shrimp harvesting off the coast of Florida for the next month or two. He doesn't have any contacts there, just plans to head to the coast and offer his labor in exchange for learning how oysters are harvested. We told him we expect good stories when he comes back."

"First, you have to get your white beans cooked. It is good to be prepared. I was relieved, upon seeing still photos of the UC Davis atrocity, that most of the kids turned their faces away from the stream of capsaicin. Be prepared! OK, once your beans are ready (and a little soupiness is fine), stir in a judicious amount of minced ham. Then get out your canning funnel. This thing is a certain Mr. C.'s new favorite gadget."

"Another hindrance on physics and engineering sectors has been the increase in funding to the National Institute of Health. According to David Kramer in Physics Today, the money allotted to the NIH by Congress has increased more than the Department of Energy, National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or even the Department of Defense (Kramer 27); although the exact numbers are adjusted to the inflation rates as of 2010. It seems a sign of the times that medications, cures for diseases, and stem cell research have become more of a priority than uniting the theory of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, even though such biological miracles are just as evasive as the Higgs Boson."
"Typically I would but because I was actually in pain it just wasn’t funny to me. Understanding the pain a ginger feels from a sunburn is very difficult for uneducated people to understand so I forgave them for being so heartless. Very fun night though aside from the sunburn and my dumb friends who aren’t funny. Wish I had just put on the sunscreen during the day though to avoid the ginger jokes, the pain and the anxiety I was getting from it. Xanax would have been clutch that way I would have stopped panicking about what everyone was thinking about me. Yes I definitely learned my lesson and I will always apply sunscreen no matter what time of the day it is. Zero sunscreen = unhappy ginger and unhappy ginger = well, aren’t gingers always unhappy? ;)"

This machine came with a zig-zag attachment which is totally rockin' awesome. Eleanor and I tried it out today for the first time and it worked beautifully. I can now sew knits! Ah!"
"""Hoarding"" in the strictest sense is the acquisition of scarce resources you don't necessarily need so that you can try to use those scarce resources to make a profit off of others at some point in the future. Maybe you're buying up the last of some item and turning around and reselling it to people who are willing to pay you a lot more than you bought it for because you got the last stuff--that's hoarding. But if there's plenty of a certain item on the shelf at the store, then buying a lot of that item and building up a surplus isn't hoarding!"

"I don’t really remember much about the last 5 miles, but I tapped into a place I didn’t even know I had. My body had absolutely nothing left to give, but I was going to run across that finish line. I have never felt a rush of adrenaline quite like it, but I sprinted the last .2 miles across the finish line. I did not meet my goal time (I wanted 4:35:00 or somewhere close to it) but I’m choosing not to focus on that for now. I finished a marathon. But what is perhaps more exciting for me is the fact that I struggled so much and didn’t give up. It really makes me feel like, if I can survive that, I can do anything."

"3)I’m loving Northern Ireland. Its exactly what I thought it would be, maybe even better. I tried to keep it as down to Earth as possible when doing my research for relocating so I dug deep into everything bad I could find about it, so as to move within a certain margin of error so to speak. Its beautiful, safe, not as expensive as England or Scotland. It rains a lot of course, but it never gets that cold. This winter there was no snow in my area at all. Schools are great, great place to raise kids. Gun laws aren’t as bad as in the rest of UK, you can own handguns. Houses here are nicer than in England and Scotland, a bit more American without being cheesy and poorly built Mc Mansions for the most. I like how the urbanization is laid out. You have lustrous green countryside all over with mostly small towns and cities sprinkled evenly. Everything is surprisingly clean and tidy, people don’t litter as much as they do in USA, let alone South America cities which at times it looks like a dumpsters. Gasoline is very expensive, about 9 or 10 dollars a gallon! Thanks fully I don’t have to drive that much and it does help a lot that the country is relatively small, so in spite of the price difference if everything is 2 or 3 times closer compared to the distances you would have to drive in USA, the price of fuel has much less of an impact."

"I have enjoyed our local zoo since Renee's first trip at five months old. Our pass allows us to come and go as often as we want, and we always have lunch at various places in the zoo. Today, Kristen and I sat on a park bench looking out over the African Savanna. I think I was more excited today to take her because I cherish it so much with her. I will never get over the fact that the things I thought we lost at her birth are so part of our life...so normal...so wonderful...and so much more rich because of our journey. A simple trip with her to the zoo is celebrated. She was so animated at every thing we saw, and her excitement and smiles are truly extremely contagious. She walked by my side and wanted nothing to do with holding my hand. ""I am five"" she tells me. Apparently, holding hands is for little kids. So, I made it clear if you walk by me I will not have to hold your hand. That kid stuck right by my side. Those simple things in life make me so happy and proud now."

"A note to copy editors:"
"I was pretty tired yesterday after my early call from Australia and my fun day on the hill at Kintail, one hill and the legs are sore, I must get fit? As I walked off down the track past the end of the South Cluanie ridge I felt great. This is unusual as in the past Creag a’ Mhain is the end of a long day of 7 -9 Munros depending on how one does it this classic walk. I worked out that Teallach my dog had done that 9 Munros – 7 times in his life every time all in one day with me and had twice attempted the Great traverse of the South and North Cluanie plus a few others of 19 -20 Munros in a day. On the successful attempt with Teallach when we stopped at the Cluanie Inn for a break he was not impressed as we continued down the road to Carn Ghulasaid and the rest of a huge 23 hour day. We travelled very light and left some more food behind the Cluanie Inn, some bivy but it was “light and slow” a pair of Walshes “running shoes” and minimal kit and lots of snacks and drinks. It was how fast you could do them in these days but what a feeling being out on such a special place, travelling light, running much of the easy bits of the ridge and being fit enough to enjoy these wonderful hills. You become as one with the hills on days like that and each point a personal battle with the mind and body to continue. The knowledge I had of these ridges was great as you knew where to go and the map was only a check with the Munros marked and roughly the times for each one to remind you and try to keep to a planned schedule. Each Munro done, was one less to do. What a companion Teallach was, what a hill dog and he kept me going all that long day and many others. He was so attuned to the hill, he never chased anything, wild life were safe as were people, but not their food. He just enjoyed the openness of the hill, the wild land, what a companion. At the end of a huge day we were both struggling and he was following in my footsteps unusual for him. He was still able to rush ahead when he saw a wee lochan or mud and dive in.It was two weary companions who struggled off back to the car and exhaustion, I can still feel the pain when it all ended. What a dog for the 12 years of his life, he saw so much and did so much. As I walked down the track yesterday to the Inn I could see him bounding ahead, maybe picking up a bit of bog wood or diving into a river, to be young and daft again. Now it is a different and older person who wandered down the track one Corbett was still a grand day and it is funny now we treated the hills in our youth."
