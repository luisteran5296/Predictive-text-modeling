It's a lot easier to hit in a lineup where guys are making things happens and pitchers are on the defensive."""

"Initial efforts to lay blame upon the president -- who was betrayed by both the GSA director he had appointed and by the Secret Service and military personnel tasked to protect him in Cartagena -- were predictable enough. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, suggested that Obama is somehow “responsible” for overspending on a GSA conference in Las Vegas simply because he appointed the agency’s head (whom he promptly fired when the abuses came to his attention). She has been in government long enough to know that the president can scarcely oversee every dollar -- and while $860,000 sounds like a lot of money, it is a vanishingly small sum in a nearly $4 trillion federal budget. Grandstanding politicians like her often compare the nation’s expenditures, with false naivete, to a household budget.

"That would both improve existing train service and make the rails fit for high-speed trains when they arrive. It also serves another purpose: The better commuter train service becomes, the more Californians will get used to riding the rails routinely.

That's vital to future bullet train financing, which has rested from the start on a presumption that once California's $9.9 billion in bonds, plus some billions more in federal aid, are spent, private investors will move in. They won't until and unless they're convinced ridership will actually reach the optimistic levels often predicted by the rail authority."

Dirt mounds created by the extensive excavation at the site are incorporated in Hood's design to mimic the sand dunes on which Golden Gate Park was built. On the west side, the Barbro Osher sculpture garden visible from the museum cafe, will showcase the work of Isamu Nogucci and others as well as a subterranean stupa shaped camera obscura -- a folly by artist James Turrell.

They have been restored in time for the museum's inaugural traveling exhibition -- the art of Hatshepsut, Egypt's female Pharoah whose temple decorations at Deir El Bahri pay homage to a love of gardens. Also on the east side, in a whimsical Wonderland for children where a fog machine periodically obscures a garden path that leads to nothing but a wall of eucalyptus leaves, Hood has placed bronzes of animals; a formal asphalt-paved pathway past these pieces leads to a non- garden -- a shallow grassy bowl from where you can gaze at the park's tree canopy."

But when researchers studied people prone to precancerous colon polyps, those who took high-dose folic acid -- 1,000 micrograms a day -- for three years had more new polyps than people given a dummy pill. And in March, researchers tracked 640 men from that earlier study and found that 10 years later, the folic acid users were more likely to have developed prostate cancer."

"That he spent his pocket money on something he would grow up to research is prophetic. But it happened that way. Ortega immigrated to Houston in 1984 without any contacts or job prospects - just the determination to make it in America. He started out as a dishwasher and later became a busboy at a down town Houston restaurant. Eventually he found his way to Backstreet Café where he found work as a dishwasher/busboy. Owner Tracy Vaught, who saw promise in Ortega, offered him a job on the line in the kitchen. He learned that job well enough to be promoted to the kitchen at Prego, which Vaught also owned. Impressed by his dedication, Vaught enrolled Ortega in the culinary arts program at Houston Community College, from which he graduated in 1992. He worked his way up to executive chef at Backstreet Café in 1995 and eventually was invited twice to cook at the James Beard House in New York. In 2002, Vaught and Ortega opened Hugo's, specializing in authentic regional Mexican cuisine.

"Americans like vegetables nearly raw, so when I go to a French brasserie, I order the haricot verts ($5). The Europeans have a way of cooking them so they're tender with just a modicum of crunch. However, at Cafe Claude they were a dull Army green and bordered on mushy. It also seemed like we got leftover pommes frites ($5); the entire stack of potatoes looked like small end pieces and was served at room temperature."

"If you’re put off by this band’s handle, it’s hard to blame you. Why a period after Portugal, but none after The Man, for instance? It suggests imprecision, and perhaps an inability to properly punctuate musical phrases. In the past, these Wasilla, Alaska psych-rockers have been guilty of failing to develop their ideas, but with each release, the songwriting has caught up a little more with the instrumental talents of the four musicians. It’s still not all the way there, but “In the Mountain in the Cloud” is the band’s most realized work yet — a hybrid of modern-day glam rock, freewheeling jam band roots music and ’70s prog. (One bass outro is so close to Yes’ “Heart of the Sunrise” it ought to have quotes around it.)Songwriter John Gourley has always been able to come up with catchy bits; here he has managed to fashion them into choruses of zonked grandeur. “Got It All (This Can’t Be Living Now),” “So American” and especially “Everything You See (Kids Count Hallelujahs)” are impressive post-Bowie art-pop compositions. As for what it is that the excitable Gourley is singing about in that helium falsetto … well, that’s between him and the sandman."

"The judge had increased the bail in response to Bianchi's concern that Fajardo-Santos had posted the lower bail and now was to be turned over to the custody of the federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement on a detainer. Bianchi feared that Fajardo-Santos, while in ICE custody, would consent to deportation and be sent back to Honduras -- essentially avoiding prosecution on the sex-assault charges. That's what happened in December in a case involving another illegal Honduran charged with child-sex assault, Carlos Ulloa-Murillo."

"In baseball, the invention of the pitch-by-pitch record, reliably available only since 1988, has turned out to be important for much more than capturing the drama of one riveting seventh inning long ago. We now understand its utility for managing a pitcher's productivity, health and longevity. We don't need to go beyond Koufax to see that throwing too many pitches over too short a time can lead to debilitating injury. Despite suffering excruciating pain from arthritis in his elbow, he sometimes pitched under conditions that today would be considered abusive -- entire games on just two days' rest, for example. Baseball eventually figured out what constitutes abuse through analysis of the effects of game and season pitch counts, days of rest and age of the pitcher on performance and injury."
"The biggest marquee names wrapped the show. Fred Armisen is practically an honorary Portlander now, what with his and Carrie Brownstein's ""Portlandia."" His routine was a loose series of unlikely impressions, most of them musical. He imitated the drumming styles of Ringo Starr, Keith Moon and Charlie Watts; revealed a deep lack of interest in jazz; did a brief but killer Elvis Costello imitation; and reprised the lyrically impoverished ditty he and Bryan Cranston debuted on ""Saturday Night Live"" about sending a bottle of sparkling apple juice. Did you get it?"
"The Vikings recently made a call from its stockholders for $20 million, and while the Wilf family has never said no to the football executives to spend money to attract a great player such as Jared Allen, I have to believe there was a reason why the club signed only one top free agent this year in John Carlson for $5 million per season."

I was able to get a couple breaks in the first game in Pittsburgh and after that things kind of got rolling.”"

"Many members of the Los Angeles City Council think poorly ofWal-Mart, and with some good reason. They fear the giant retailer's reputation for crowding small businesses out of neighborhoods, and they are sensitive to the charge that the company's commitment to holding down prices comes at the expense of salary and benefits for its nonunion workforce. Egged on by their supporters in organized labor, members of the council will take up a proposal Friday to impose a temporary moratorium on retail development in Chinatown. That measure in theory would block any large chain store from locating there; in practice, it is aimed at just one: Wal-Mart, which has proposed a 33,000-square-foot grocery. The council's move may be understandable, but the proposal is unwise and counterproductive."

"Under Putin, the Chechen rebellion was put down, except for an apparently small contingent of holdouts, through a combination of brutality and largesse. Russian artillery barrages turned Grozny, the Chechen capital, into jagged ruins. Soldiers and police hunted down rebels, their supporters — and, many critics say, hapless and innocent civilians. The Kremlin backed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov's notoriously brutal security force and poured billions of dollars into reconstructing Grozny."
"GOP sneak attack update. A month or so back, Republican Assemblyman Chuck DeVore of Irvine had - unbeknownst to him, as it turned out - let me in on his political strategy for ""eff-ing"" with the Democrats, as he put it. Speaking at Chapman, he'd disclosed his plan behind a bill he'd authored to give a five-year ""holiday"" to the state's tough environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act. This exemption from CEQA would apply only to inner-city infill development projects, low-income housing and farm-worker housing."

And yet, some chance is better than none."
"Derek Jeter showed up at that A-Rod press conference at Yankee Stadium to show his support as the Captain.

"The Watchdog reported in a March 16, 2011, article that Anderson was one of the 20th highest paid public officials in the state in 2009. What they failed to report was that out of the 20 employees identified, seven, including Anderson, are administrators of district and public hospitals. Hospital administrators are compensated for the expertise they provide in overseeing highly complex major medical institutions and all of the financial, legal, compliance and regulatory issues they are responsible for managing. There are some 55 federal, state and local agencies they are ultimately responsible to, reporting to or taking oversight from. Ultimately, they are responsible for human lives and patient outcomes. While these CEOs are employed by districts, their responsibilities are commensurate with those of private and not-for-profit hospitals. In fact, the truth is that Anderson is the lowest paid, not the highest paid, of the CEOs of the large district hospitals in the state. His peers at Palomar Pomerado Health System, Salinas Valley Memorial Health, Washington Township, Kaweah Delta Health System, Marin Health, and Antelope Valley Hospital all make more than Anderson in both base pay and benefits. Additionally, all of these compensation packages were determined by publicly elected boards exercising their duties of care, loyalty and obedience to their constituents, communities and patients."
